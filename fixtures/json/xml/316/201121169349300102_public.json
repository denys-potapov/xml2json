As researched and developed by the Oregon Social Learning Center, MTFC places juvenile offenders who need residential treatment with foster families who are trained to provide close supervision, fair limits, consistent consequences and a supportive relationship. Research on MTFC programs in this country has proven it to be a cost effective and efficacious approach. Within the MTFC model, a youth's program can be individualized to fit his or her needs, challenges and strengths. Rather than placing them in group settings, MTFC places carefully selected youth in a family setting away from peers who have similar problems and may provide negative influence. This promotes learning and adjustment within a normalizing family setting.
