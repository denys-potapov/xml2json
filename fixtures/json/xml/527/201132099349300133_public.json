We noted at the time that care of the chronically ill would likely shift to community-based versus facility-based settings, and that the breadth of EMHS providers (including home health and long-term care) and our investments in information technology well positioned the system to embrace change.Today, as our 2010 report is published, healthcare reform is the law of the land. While details of the reform continue to be debated, many of the expected changes are underway. EMHS is not only positioned to embrace these changes, we are helping to lead the way, thanks in part to early planning and investments in our information technology infrastructure.For instance, healthcare reform brought the promise of federal stimulus funding to reimburse providers who have demonstrated \"meaningful use\" of information technology to improve patient care. By meaningful use, we mean that healthcare providers use technology to capture data in real time to support their treatment decisions and build on computerized protocols, or guidelines, for best practices. It also means that yourEMHS primary care provider uses computerized registries of chronic disease treatment plan elements that have been proven to improve quality of care in a preventative and proactive manner.In 2010, EMHS hospitals and physician practices initiated an ambitious project, which we call eQuest. While EMHS has already been recognized for its leadership in using information technology, the pace of investments, measured in terms of both dollars and staff expertise, needed to speed up if we were to maximize our opportunities for federal meaningful use funding. Literally hundreds of staff across our organization are intensely focused on taking EMHS to the highest levels of meaningful use in the months ahead.eQuest is organizing and focusing those efforts so that, together, we optimize this one time opportunity for federal funds.A second example of federal funding supporting a reformed delivery system is the Bangor Beacon Community initiative. Last spring, EMHS received a nearly $13 million dollar grant to demonstrate improvements in the delivery of care, using clinical information technology. EMHS' grant application is one of only 17 receiving federal funds through this competitive process across the United States. Our Beacon colleagues are among some of the most advanced healthcare systems in the nation. The EMHS Beacon application was highly regarded because of its inclusion of multiple providers (both within and outside EMHS) at multiple levels of care (including home health, long term care and other community based settings) and because of our already advanced state of linking providers via information technology. In fact, because EMHS already has a highly functioning information infrastructure in place, we have been asked to lead national Beacon affinity groups on leadership, communication, and project management. There is a statewide advisory committee attached to the Bangor Beacon Community so that learned experiences can be disseminated across all healthcare providers in Maine, continuing EMHS' commitment to sharing expertise and resources with other providers in our efforts to improve healthcare delivery for all Mainers. Additionally, at the end of the three year grant, all 17 Beacon grantees are to publish their results for nationwide learning and improvement. EMHS is extremely proud to be participating in this national effort.Within this 2010 annual report, you will read about the great work our member organizations do every day in caring for the people of Maine. We hope this will give you some valuable insight into the passion, dedication and expertise of our some 8000 employees. We appreciate your support of EMHS and all of our members.George Eaton, Esq.EMHS Board ChairM.
