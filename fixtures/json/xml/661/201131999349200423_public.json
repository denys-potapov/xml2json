Botanical Gardens volunteers are recruited each year to prepare, fertilize and plant annuals and perennials which enhance the Gardens' flower beds. Many new plants, trees and other woody shrubs were added to the plant collections within the Gardens this year. Ongoing routine maintenance, plant replacement and repairs were also part of the Gardens' seasonal projects.The Botanical Gardens continues to contract with the Dunsmuir Parks & Recreation District for the services of a part-time gardener dedicated solely for the care and maintenance of the Gardens from March through October. The gardener, with the supervision and direction of the volunteer Gardens Oversight Chair, a horticulturalist and biologist, plants, weeds, prunes, oversees the irrigation schedule and makes needed repairs, deadheads, fertilizes and notifies the Gardens Oversight Chair of any special needs in the Gardens. The Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens continued its membership in the American Public Gardens Association. The purpose of the Association is to provide educational and technical assistance and resources to public gardens. It provides national exposure to member gardens through their membership listing and provides access to resources that will improve the educational opportunities within the Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens.", "GrantsAndAllocations": "14559"}, {"DescriptionProgramServiceAccom": "BOTANICAL GARDENS- CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMThe Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens (DBG) received a $5,000 Union Pacific Foundation grant for the creation of a Crevice Rock Garden and another $2,500 donation for Gardens maintenance. The DBG engaged Josef Halda in April to install the Crevice Rock Garden which became a community project with Weed Community Day School students helping with the planting. Throughout the season, repairs, expansion and improvements to the irrigation systems were made. Volunteers and staff planted perennials and annuals in the Gardens in May. A grant of $9,975 received in November of 2009 from the Shasta Regional Community Foundation was used to purchase interpretive signage, identification plant tags and a laptop and software to create an accession database of the Gardens plant collections as well as additional funds for the completion of the Crevice Rock Garden project in 2010. A community service project for Dunsmuir High School students was developed to refurbish and repair all of the memorial benches that are placed throughout the Botanical Gardens. Dunsmuir High School's woodshop students will complete the project in spring 2011. The Dunsmuir High School Senior class spends one day, as a part of their community service requirements, working with DBG volunteers and staff getting the Gardens ready for the growing season. Students plant, rake, clean-up debris and spread soil conditioner throughout the Gardens.The Alexander Dunsmuir Fountain Fund was established in 2003 through private donations. The donations are designated for the restoration and maintenance of the fountain donated by the Dunsmuir family in the early 1890's and which is now located at the entrance of the Dunsmuir City Park. This year the DBG coordinated the resurfacing of the basin of the fountain to protect it from the harsh Dunsmuir winters. The Dunsmuir High School 2010 Reunion alumni established a memorial fund in the name of Reva Coon for the purchase of a special addition to the Gardens' native plant collection. The remaining funds will be used as needed in 2011 for new plants.", "GrantsAndAllocations": "21730"}, {"DescriptionProgramServiceAccom": "OUTREACH / EDUCATION PROGRAMIn 2007 the Financial Planning Committee presented a Marketing Plan to the Board of Directors. The purpose of the Marketing Plan was to enhance visibility, visitation and usage of the Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens and increase awareness of their unique contribution to Dunsmuir and Southern Siskiyou County. In 2010 the Botanical Gardens has worked to expand the educational outreach to the identified target markets, children, other southern Siskiyou County communities, area businesses, travelers and Dunsmuir citizens.The Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens (DBG) continues to maintain and develop the website for the promotion of the organization's mission and activities. The use of the internet is crucial for increasing awareness of DBG and what it offers as an educational and horticultural resource. Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens continues to update and distribute a color, tri-fold brochure throughout the area. The brochure was professionally designed and widely distributed throughout northern California, southern Oregon and Dunsmuir.This year a newsletter, published quarterly, From the Gardens' Bench, was created to improve communication with the community and the Sustaining Membership of the Botanical Gardens.A public workshop was held to kick-off the first annual photo contest of the Botanical Gardens ending with a public gallery showing in November. The work of entrants was judged by a panel of area professional photographers and awarded ribbons. Visitors to the photo gallery in the weeks leading up to the showing and reception were asked to vote for their favorite photo for the People's Choice Award. The Division winners each received $50.00. The photos will be used in the future for marketing and promotion of the Botanical Gardens. During the month of July, the Botanical Gardens offered a workshop for the public about bats and their contribution to a healthy garden environment. Many of the over 50 participants expressed their appreciation for the interesting and informative workshop. The Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens joined other community organizations by participating in the city-wide \"Dogwood Daze\" celebration and provided guided tours of the Botanical Gardens native dogwood collection. Several guided tours for the public, local organizations and members of area garden clubs from Mt. Shasta, Redding, and Medford were led by Gardens' volunteers during the year.", "GrantsAndAllocations": "2729"}], "OfficerDirectorTrusteeKeyEmpl": [{"AddressUS": {"AddressLine1": "PO BOX 242", "City":
