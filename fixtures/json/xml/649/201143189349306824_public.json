THE ATTACHED TEXT WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MERIDIAN HOSPITALS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ------------------------------------- THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS. THE CORPORATION HAS IMPLEMENTED A MONTHLY STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO ESTIMATE AND REVIEW THE COLLECTIBILITY OF RECEIVABLES BASED ON THE PAYOR CLASSIFICATION AND THE PERIOD FROM WHICH THE RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING. ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE WHEN MANAGEMENT FEELS IT IS PROBABLE THE RECEIVABLE WILL NOT BE RECOVERED. HISTORICAL COLLECTION AND PAYOR REIMBURSEMENT EXPERIENCE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS.

THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (\"IRC\") 501(C)(3). THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (\"AHA\") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (\"MEDPAC\") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED \"DUAL ELIGIBLES.\" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (\"CBO\") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT \"THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.\" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS \"SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS\" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITALS' BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY.

THE COMMITTEE CONVENES ON A REGULAR BASIS, HAS DEVELOPED A WORK PLAN TO ENSURE GOALS AND DELIVERABLES ARE ACHIEVED, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARD TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. USING A NATIONALLY RENOWNED RESEARCH FIRM, MERIDIAN SURVEYED 1,000 HOUSEHOLDS VIA TELEPHONE IN MONMOUTH AND OCEAN COUNTIES TO GATHER LOCAL RESIDENTS' VIEWS OF THEIR COMMUNITY'S MOST CRITICAL HEALTH NEEDS. THIS COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT, A FOLLOW-UP TO A SIMILAR STUDY CONDUCTED IN 2006, IS A SYSTEMATIC, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO DETERMINING THE HEALTH STATUS, BEHAVIORS AND NEEDS OF OUR RESIDENTS AND WILL SERVE AS A TOOL TO REACHING THREE BASIC GOALS: TO IMPROVE RESIDENTS' HEALTH STATUS, AND ELEVATE THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, TO REDUCE THE HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG RESIDENTS AND TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR ALL RESIDENTS. THE SURVEY INSTRUMENT USED FOR THE STUDY IS LARGELY BASED ON THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION'S BEHAVIORAL RISK SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEYS AND CUSTOMIZED QUESTIONS ADDRESSING GAPS IN INDICATOR DATA RELATIVE TO HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION AS WELL AS OTHER RECOGNIZED HEALTH ISSUES. THE SAMPLE DESIGN FOR THIS EFFORT CONSISTED OF A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE OF 1,054 INDIVIDUALS AGE 18 AND OLDER AND WAS CONSTRUCTED TO INCLUDE MINIMUM SAMPLE THRESHOLDS FOR EACH HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA AS WELL AS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO RESPONDENTS. IN ADDITION, FIVE FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A TOTAL OF 32 KEY PERSONS IN THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITALS' COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEES, LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS. THESE FINDINGS REPRESENT QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN QUANTITATIVE DATA. THE GROUPS WERE DESIGNED TO GATHER INPUT FROM PARTICIPANTS REGARDING THEIR OPINIONS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE AREA. A VARIETY OF SECONDARY DATA SOURCES WERE ALSO CONSULTED TO COMPLEMENT THE SURVEY AND FOCUS GROUP DATA AND INCLUDES; STATE OF NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES, NEW JERSEY UNIFORM CRIME REPORT, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS RESEARCH INSTITUTE BUSINESS INFORMATION SOLUTIONS GROUP DEMOGRAPHIC PORTFOLIO (PROJECTIONS BASED ON US CENSUS) AND NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS. THESE SOURCES HAVE DATA AND INFORMATION ON PRIMARY AND CHRONIC DISEASE NEEDS AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES OF THE UNINSURED, LOW INCOME AND MINORITY GROUPS. ADDITIONALLY, THESE AND OTHER SECONDARY SOURCES WERE USED TO DEVELOP A LIST OF EXISTING RESOURCES OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AT MERIDIAN AS WELL AS OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE AREA. MERIDIAN HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR SOURCES OF BENCHMARKING DATA THAT IT WILL USE THROUGHOUT THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND INCLUDES, TRENDING DATA FROM THE SIMILAR SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2006, NEW JERSEY RISK FACTOR DATA FROM SECONDARY SOURCES LISTED PREVIOUSLY, NATIONWIDE RISK FACTOR DATA, ALSO FROM SECONDARY SOURCES AND FINALLY, HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 TARGETS. HEALTHY PEOPLE PROVIDES SCIENCE-BASED, 10-YEAR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES FOR IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF ALL AMERICANS. FINDINGS OF THE ASSESSMENT ARE REVIEWED TOGETHER WITH MERIDIAN'S COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEES, LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, PHYSICIANS, OTHER AREA HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS, WITH THE GOAL OF SELECTING AND PRIORITIZING THE TOP HEALTH CONCERNS FOR MERIDIAN AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WILL RESULT IN HOSPITAL-BASED, COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH WILL BE COMPLETE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.

THIS INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A GROUP OF AFFILIATED HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS.

AS THE PARENT ORGANIZATION OF A LARGE TAX-EXEMPT INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN NEW JERSEY, MERIDIAN STRIVES TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP AND OPERATE A MULTI-HOSPITAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT THROUGH THE PROVISION OF A COMPREHENSIVE SPECTRUM OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS OF MONMOUTH AND OCEAN COUNTIES AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. MERIDIAN ENSURES THAT ITS SYSTEM PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. NO INDIVIDUALS ARE DENIED NECESSARY MEDICAL CARE, TREATMENT OR SERVICES. SYSTEM ACTIVE HOSPITALS INCLUDE: JERSEY SHORE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, RIVERVIEW MEDICAL CENTER, OCEAN MEDICAL CENTER AND K.

AT MERIDIAN HEALTH, WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE CARE WE PROVIDE THROUGH OUR HOSPITALS AND PARTNER COMPANIES REACHES FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR FACILITIES. OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IS AT THE HEART OF OUR CHARITABLE ROOTS. IN THIS NEW ERA OF HEALTHCARE REFORM, COMMUNITY BASED PREVENTION AND WELLNESS ACTIVITIES WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN KEEPING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES HEALTHY AND KEEPING HEALTH CARE COSTS DOWN. MERIDIAN REMAINS COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING ITS MISSION AND IN 2010, DEVOTED MORE THAN $94 MILLION IN COMMUNITY BENEFITS.

MERIDIAN'S 2010 COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORT CAN BE FOUND ONLINE AT WWW.MERIDIANHEALTH.COM OR ON REQUEST THROUGH ANY ONE OF OUR FACILITIES. FACING HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES ---------------------------- EVERY DAY, HOSPITALS FACE HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES HEAD-ON, WHETHER TREATING A PATIENT WHO PRESENTS AT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN MEDICAL CRISIS, EDUCATING AND SCREENING PATIENTS TO PREVENT DISEASE, OR KEEPING THE HOSPITAL OPEN DURING A TIME OF INCREASED ECONOMIC PRESSURE. MERIDIAN HEALTH IS PROUD THAT IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY PROVIDE AND ENHANCE TO ITS ROBUST COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROGRAM DESPITE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES. BY COMMUNITY BENEFITS, WE ARE REFERRING TO THOSE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT OR COULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT THE SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT OF MERIDIAN'S SIX HOSPITALS: JERSEY SHORE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, OCEAN MEDICAL CENTER, RIVERVIEW MEDICAL CENTER, BAYSHORE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, SOUTHERN OCEAN MEDICAL CENTER AND K. HOVNANIAN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. IN 2010, MERIDIAN HEALTH INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROVIDE CARE TO THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR HEALTHCARE, TO ABSORB THE SHORTFALLS OF GOVERNMENTAL PAYERS AND MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS AND TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SCREENINGS AND OTHER PREVENTIVE EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES THAT IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE SUCCESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MERIDIAN'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF THE EFFORTS OF ITS COMMITTED STAFF OF PHYSICIANS, NURSES, HEALTHCARE SPECIALISTS AND COMMUNITY EDUCATORS ALONG WITH DEDICATED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HELP MERIDIAN IDENTIFY, DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INITIATIVES THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY."}, {"Identifier": "COMMUNITY BENEFIT STATEMENT (CONTINUED)", "ReturnReference": "CORE FORM, PART III; STATEMENT OF PROGRAM SERVICE ACCOMPLISHMENTS", "Explanation": "DELIVERING ON COMMUNITY COMMITMENT ---------------------------------- HOSPITALS TODAY FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES. REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES, WHETHER FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR FROM MANAGED CARE COMPANIES, RARELY COVERS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF QUALITY CARE. NEARLY 17 PERCENT OF NEW JERSEY'S POPULATION LIVES WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, MANY FOREGO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE. AS A RESULT, THEY OFTEN LAND IN EMERGENCY ROOMS IN MEDICAL CRISIS, PLACING THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THEIR CARE BACK ON THE SHOULDERS OF AREA HOSPITALS. ADD TO THAT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO PREPARE FOR THE UNEXPECTED, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK OR FLU PANDEMIC, AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE MULTITUDE OF CHALLENGES FACING ALREADY STRAINED HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. IN SPITE OF ALL THIS, MERIDIAN HEALTH DELIVERS ON ITS COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN MONMOUTH AND OCEAN COUNTIES. MERIDIAN PROVIDES A CONTINUUM OF CARE THROUGH ITS SIX HOSPITALS - JERSEY SHORE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, OCEAN MEDICAL CENTER, RIVERVIEW MEDICAL CENTER, BAYSHORE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, SOUTHERN OCEAN MEDICAL CENTER AND K. HOVNANIAN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - AS WELL AS THROUGH OCEAN CARE CENTER, THE AREA'S FIRST 24-HOUR SATELLITE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS, AND OUR MANY PARTNER COMPANIES. CARING FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY --------------------------------------- PEOPLE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FOREGO PREVENTIVE CARE AND SEEK TREATMENT ONLY WHEN THEIR ILLNESSES REQUIRE VISITS TO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS. BY THAT TIME, THEIR ILLNESSES TYPICALLY ARE MORE ADVANCED AND MORE COSTLY TO TREAT. MERIDIAN'S OUTREACH EFFORTS AND PROGRAMS HAVE ENCOURAGED MANY TO WALK THROUGH ITS DOORS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE GONE WITHOUT NECESSARY HEALTH CARE. IN 2010, MERIDIAN PROVIDED $51.8 MILLION IN CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS FOR WHICH WE RECEIVED NO PAYMENT. WE ALSO PROVIDE A MEDICAL \"SAFETY NET\" TO THE AREA'S NEEDY BY DEVOTING MORE THAN $7.1 MILLION TO SUBSIDIZING VITAL HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FAMILY HEALTH CLINICS. IN ADDITION, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OFTEN DO NOT COVER ALL THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING QUALITY PATIENT CARE. IN 2010, MERIDIAN SPENT MORE THAN $36.4 MILLION IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE THAT WAS NOT REIMBURSED BY ANY OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS. TRAINING OUR DOCTORS AND NURSES ------------------------------- TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IS VITAL TO PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR SOUND HEALTH IN OUR COMMUNITY. MERIDIAN ENCOURAGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICIANS, NURSES, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS, AND THOSE ENTERING ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS BY SUPPORTING THEIR EDUCATION AND OFFERING CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN OUR HOSPITALS.IN 2010, MERIDIAN PROVIDED $40.1 MILLION IN BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER GOVERNMENTAL SUBSIDIES WHICH HELP SUPPORT MEDICAL TRAINING. NO ONE PROVIDES MORE HANDS-ON CARE THAN OUR NURSES WHO PROVIDE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS. MERIDIAN'S ANN MAY NURSING CENTER SERVES AS A RESOURCE TO EACH OF THE NURSING DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE MERIDIAN HEALTH FAMILY FOR EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT OF STUDENT NURSES, FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND RESEARCH INITIATIVES. THE CENTER SUPPORTED THE EDUCATION OF SEVERAL HUNDRED NURSES IN 2010, PROVIDING STUDENT EXTERNSHIPS AND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY, OVER $300,000 WAS DISTRIBUTED IN NURSING SCHOLARSHIPS. MERIDIAN HEALTH NURSES CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO PATIENT CARE, THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE PROFESSION OF NURSING. MERIDIAN NURSES ARE KNOWN NOT ONLY FOR THE FINEST QUALITY CARE THEY DELIVER TO PATIENTS BUT ALSO THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY MAKE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE NURSING SCIENCE. OVER 75% OF NURSES ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED IN THEIR AREA OF CLINICAL EXPERTISE! THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF NURSES WHO ARE CERTIFIED IS BETWEEN 11 AND 15% AND AMONGST MAGNET FACILITIES IT IS 22%. SUPPORTING LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS ------------------------------ OVER THE YEARS, MERIDIAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO OFFER SUPPORT THROUGH CHARITABLE DONATIONS TO A HOST OF WORTHY, LOCAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. MERIDIAN ALSO ENCOURAGES OUR LEADERS, PHYSICIANS, AND TEAM MEMBERS TO SERVE ON A VARIETY OF BOARDS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY RECOGNIZES THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND THE CRITICAL NEED TO HAVE AND RETAIN EXECUTIVES THAT CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATE SUPERIOR LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE SO THAT THE HEALTH SYSTEM CAN FULFILL ITS CHARITABLE MISSION. THE COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE \"TOTAL COMPENSATION\" OF THE INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING BOTH CURRENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND ALL EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, BOTH QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THE \"TOTAL COMPENSATION\" OF THE PRESIDENT AND EACH SENIOR MANAGEMENT KEY EMPLOYEE IS REASONABLE. TO ASSIST WITH THE REVIEW, THE COMMITTEE ENGAGES THE SERVICES OF A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED INDEPENDENT CONSULTING FIRM SPECIALIZING IN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR NOT FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS, AND RECEIVES REGIONAL MARKET DATA FOR COMPARABLE ORGANIZATIONS, A REPORT SUMMARIZING SUCH DATA, AND AN OPINION LETTER RELATING TO THE REASONABLENESS OF EACH EXECUTIVE'S TOTAL COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.

THE AUTHORIZED BODY ADEQUATELY DOCUMENTS THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION CONCURRENTLY WITH MAKING THAT DETERMINATION, AGAIN AS REQUIRED IN THE REGULATIONS.
