Through the many efforts of staff, the training meetings, and the educational materials produced, college-aged adults are provided an opportunity to learn life-long service leadership skills. Members of CKI learn such skills by participating in leadership workshops and seminars, performing community service activities through their local CKI club, leading the organization on a member-elected Board, working as officers and members of their local CKI clubs, working with other adults in sponsoring Kiwanis Clubs, and receiving leadership and service materials provided by the international organization. Many materials and education meetings help to walk students through the steps of service leadership in order to envision, enlist, embody, empower, evaluate, and encourage. Students learn that true leadership is based on servant leadership, which requires leaders to put the needs of others first, and to realize that no matter whether or not you have a title, there is always a need for service to one another and to the world. Many CKI programs take members of CKI through activities and service projects together - gaining hands-on experience with other service-minded adults.", "TotalOfOtherProgramServiceExp": "4503",
