"Explanation": "ATRIUS HEALTH IS A 501(C)(3) ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS ITS AFFILIATED GROUPS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THEIR PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES. IN FULFILLMENT OF THE ABOVE MISSION, ATRIUS HEALTH ADVOCATES ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES ON BEHALF OF OUR CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS ON ISSUES RELATED TO PAYMENT REFORM, HEALTH CARE REFORM AND FUNDING FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THE OFFICE OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS DIRECTS THESE ACTIVITIES AND COORDINATES OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD. ON OCCASION, ATRIUS HEALTH PROVIDES WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE AND TESTIMONY TO KEY LEGISLATORS AND MEETS WITH STATE AND LOCAL LEGISLATORS AND OFFICIALS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. IN 2010, THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS MANAGER REGISTERED WITH THE STATE AS A LOBBYIST, DEDICATING A PORTION OF HER TIME TO LOBBYING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE LAW, ATRIUS HEALTH ALSO REGISTERED ITS CEO, ITS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND CHIEF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER AS LOBBYISTS, ALTHOUGH THEIR TIME INVOLVED IN THESE EFFORTS WERE MINIMAL. ATRIUS HEALTH UTILIZED THE SERVICES OF TWO OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS, ONE OF WHOM ASSISTED SOLELY ON STATE MATTERS AND THE SECOND DEVOTED TO FEDERAL ADVOCACY MATTERS. IN BOTH CASES, THESE GROUPS FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS PRIMARILY ON HEALTH CARE REFORM.
