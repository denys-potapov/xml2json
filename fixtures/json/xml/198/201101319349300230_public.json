The volunteer Board of Trustees sets the strategic direction for the Hospital and is comprised of community members from the Hospital's service area. This group is made up of local business owners, professionals and retirees. Maine Coast's non-profit status allows the hospital to reinvest any excess of revenues over expense back into the hospital to continuously improve the medical care it delivers.

The annual report is available three months after fiscal year end. Within the annual report the hospital describes community benefit in financial terms and a summary of services is provided.
