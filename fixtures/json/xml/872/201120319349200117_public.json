The organization is responsive to the needs of the community, and so offers different courses and seminars within each major program area from time to time. Counseling. One of the most important factors contributing to the stability and development of our community is the health of families. One of Community Renewal's mission statements is, \"We all know that a healthy person needs a healthy family, and a healthy family needs a healthy community.\" (Bakke) In this organization, a priority is given to community leaders and the working poor or the gap group for counseling. Individual and family counseling is offered, as well as classes on relational skills and seminars on family issues.Neighborhood Involvement. The Organization sponsors meetings to help churches catch a vision of how they can get involved in the needs of their neighborhoods and develop more of a parish ministry with some of the \"at risk\" in our community. * Daily meetings are held with leaders in the community. Those meetings have to do with collaboration and networking over problems and issues concerning the well-being of the community. These meetings are with leaders from business, government, and the faith community.* Classes and seminars are offered on community issues and development.* The organization participates in a monthly para-church meeting called the Tucson Coalition of Compassion Ministries.* The organization participates in a monthly meeting of the social service domain for Tucson.* The organization's Executive Director, Randy Reynolds, provides a monthly teaching at a homeless shelter for a Sunday morning service.* The organization sponsors the Salt and Light Monthly Celebration. There are many people in Tucson that are focused on improving the well being of individuals and the conditions in which we live. They are leaders who are willing to serve to make this community a better place to live. Every month, Community Renewal celebrates one of the many great leaders doing great works in Tucson.* Once every two months, Community Renewal has a Pastors' Breakfast. The breakfast is a time for pastors to get together and learn and discuss the current needs in Tucson, particularly focusing on the needs of each church's surrounding area and how to partner on helping in these various areas of need.* Community Renewal participates in an annual mentor's conference, an annual prayer summit with pastors, and an annual prayer walk. * This last year we worked in collaboration to help establish restorative justice for juveniles. We are also working on establishing restorative processes in other areas besides the criminal justice system.Faith-Based Partnerships.The organization partners with local government through the county faith-based liaison who coordinates community needs and issues for Pima County. Community Partnerships.The organization also develops working relationships with business leaders who are interested in the well-being of our community. These relationships create partnerships between different sectors of our community for the common good. Consulting.Randy Reynolds, the organization's Executive Director, provides consultation to churches on organizational structure and conflict resolution. He consults with various community organizations and churches on how to mobilize the community and congregations to effect positive change in the community.
