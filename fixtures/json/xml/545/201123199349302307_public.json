We looked to identify gaps in services for the entire area, and also to try and identify opportunities for collaboration in providing those services to our communities. In addition to this assessment, the three largest hospitals in the state conducted a state-wide needs assessment that was broken down by county and service area. This too has provided us with information to use in our hospital planning sessions. We continually ask our patients if there are things that we could do better, or if there are services that they need that are not currently being offered locally. If something is identified that we have the capability to do, then we try to meet the needs of our community. One example would be expanding the hours available for walk-in services at our laboratory and x-ray departments.

Our service area consists of many small towns that use Lincoln as a hub. The hospital, school system, logging companies, and paper mill are the major employers in town. Life and industry primarily revolve around the woods of central Maine. It is an area rich with history for making paper. Maine is one of the oldest states in the nation according to the latest US Census report, and Lincoln reflects that demographic. The median resident age in 2008 was 40.7 years. Lincoln is located in a modest area of the State, where the median resident income in 2008 was $32,229. Maine's average income for that same time period was $46,581."}, {"Explanation": "Part VI, Line 6: Penobscot Valley Hospital in Lincoln, Maine provides a substantial range of free or low-cost services, care, and educational opportunities to the Lincoln Lakes Region in northern Maine. PVH is one of the largest employers in the area and provides careers for more than 225 people in a region in which people struggle to find full-time, good paying employment. PVH is also the only rural health center with emergency care in the region for many of our patients and clients. The nearest Critical Access Hospital is 30 minutes away, and the nearest full service hospital is more than 45 minutes away from PVH. Sustaining PVH's longevity not only means vital services remain nearby for our patients but also that the economic vitality of the region is better secured. During 2010, PVH partnered with many agencies to reach a broad range of people. Some of those agencies included Millinocket Regional Hospital, Health Access Network, the Town of Lincoln, the Lincoln Police Department, the Lincoln Fire Department, R.S.U. #67, Community Health and Counseling Services, Katahdin Area Partnership, Katahdin Shared Services, the Maine CDC, the Wellness Council of Maine, Colonial Acres Nursing Home, Cummings Health Care Center, the City of Bangor Public Health Department, the Penobscot County local Emergency Planning Committee, the Northeastern Maine Regional Resources Center, and River Coalition of Old Town. These partnerships allowed PVH to provide education, services, and informational materials to people in our region and help people learn to be and stay well.Blood DrivesPVH held two American Red Cross blood drives in 2010 - one in June and another in December, both at the Lincoln Knights of Columbus Hall. The blood drives resulted in more than 110 units of blood being collected for those in need.Charity CareAs more and more Mainers are going without insurance, PVH is providing more \"Free Care.\" The hospital does not turn away people who need vital care, regardless of whether they have insurance or if they are able to pay out of pocket. Consequently, during 2010, PVH gave away more than $1,028,591 in free care for patients in need. Childbirth EducationSeveral times a year, PVH provides education at low or no cost to expectant mothers and families. These classes are typically held on the weekends. Diabetes Education SeminarsThroughout the year, PVH offered several free, diabetes seminars focusing on how to manage diabetes and increasing physical activity. These are offered periodically, based on interest. PVH has the only local Diabetes Education program recognized for quality by the American Diabetes Association. The hospital's diabetes education classes are based on a sliding scale for those who are unable to pay. The program also helped form and organize a diabetes support group which now meets monthly on its own. Disaster PreparednessPVH participates in a regional disaster preparedness committee with several other agencies including doctors' groups, other hospitals, local police and fire departments, schools, and other organizations. The goal of these monthly meetings is to prepare for pandemic flu, natural disasters, or other incidents that could affect our communities as well as to find ways to work together to share resources and protect the community. Economic ImpactPVH is one of the largest employers in the Lincoln Lakes Region. By employing more than 225 people in the community, PVH is a critical leader in creating and maintaining jobs and livelihoods in the region.EducationEach week, the PVH staff places articles and ads in the local paper, the Lincoln News, and other nearby publications covering topics that are helpful to the general public. These include topics such as infection control, disease prevention, and nutritional advice.

Also during 2010, staff in the Quality Improvement department taught two sessions on quality improvement to nursing students at the University of Maine in Orono.Educational ToursStudents from local elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the region were given tours of PVH during 2010. Also, students from Northern Penobscot Technical School (Region III) and several colleges visited the hospital on tours, learning about nuclear medicine, nursing, becoming Certified Nursing Assistants, and pursuing other careers in healthcare. The hospital also gave tours for several groups of foreign students attending Lee Academy to help lessen their fears of being treated at an American hospital. Falls RisksPVH is also providing education on fall risks and measures that can be taken at home to decrease a patient's risk of falls and injury. The hospital provides patients with a handout to bring home and the following sessions have been provided:1. May 2010 - Physical Therapy provided a two-hour exercise class with fall prevention exercises at an Eastern Area Agency sponsored community event to reduce the risk of falls2. October 2010 - Physical Therapy offered free standardized balance assessments to the public at a Rehabilitation & Wellness open house providing recommendations for safetyFood Cupboard SupportThroughout the year, staff and visitors to the PVH Cafeteria place change in a special container by the checkout counter. Periodically, this change is removed and donated to the Lincoln Area Food Cupboard, which supplies food, clothing, and other necessities to people in need. In 2010, PVH collected $500 for the Lincoln Area Food Cupboard. In addition to offering financial support, staff at PVH helped the food cupboard to perform a safety audit, provided employee training to ensure the program met state guidelines, built shelving and storage racks to organize stock and ensure proper food rotation, and performed monthly follow-up inspections to ensure compliance. InfluenzaOur clinicians and support staff held multiple vaccination clinics in our immediate community as well as for the schools and the public. One clinic was held at the Lincoln Police & Fire Department to help immunize our public safety officers who may not have the chance to leave work for their vaccinations. Internships/Job ShadowingTwo college seniors interested in Case Management had the opportunity to learn about the position during an internship; the students booked over 800 hours of combined experience during their time at the hospital. Students from Region III Vocational School also had the opportunity to job shadow nurses and certified nursing assistants throughout the year.

This space is offered when it does not interfere with hospital business, at no cost to the organizations.Nursing Home PresentsEach year, the PVH staff collects presents for local nursing home residents. These gifts are given to local residents of nursing and boarding homes, who may not have received holiday gifts otherwise. The staff and residents truly look forward to each holiday season. At least three dozen presents are generally distributed. Nutritional EducationIn 2010, PVH offered a variety of nutritional, educational opportunities through seminars and small group speaking engagements. These sessions were performed through our nutritional expert and our nursing staff. Primary Care Penobscot Valley Primary Care is located in the hospital's Medical Arts Building and provides walk-in care on Wednesdays and Thursdays. In 2010, the group offered a smoking cessation open house to coincide with National Smoke-Out Day in November. Penobscot Valley Primary Care also provided a support group to help teenagers quit smoking.

These range from our infection control officer teaching kids about proper hand-washing to our laparoscopic surgeon explaining surgical procedures to kids on their level. Normally, kids are given something to help retain the material, such as coloring books, posters, informational materials for parents, or small promotional items such as hand sanitizer or bandage containers.
