Business 101 classes are offered to prospective self-employed individuals and cover the basics of what it takes to start up a new micro-business. Classes include financial review, budget and business cash flow counseling, assistance with a business plan, foreclosure counseling and debt management counseling. Those businesses that are currently in operation are encouraged to attend the Incubator Without Walls program for classroom and networking support.
