A conflict of interest exists when an Interested Director or Officer participates in or votes at a meeting of the directors that authorizes a contract, action, or transaction. A Director or Officer is considered interested in any of the following circumstances: (1) When a contract, action, or transaction is between or affects Progressive Arts Alliance, Incorporated and one or more of its Directors or Officers; or (2) When a contract, action, or transaction is between or affects Progressive Arts Alliance, Incorporated and any other organization in which one or more of Progressive Arts Alliance, Incorporated Directors or Officers are directors or officers; or (3) When a contract, action, or transaction is one in which one or more of Progressive Arts Alliance, Incorporated Directors or Officers have a financial or personal interest. (4) An interested person may include the spouse(s) or other family member(s) of the Director. A Director is not an Interested Director solely because the subject of a contract, action, or transaction may involve or effect a change in control of the Corporation or on his/her continuation in office as a Director of the corporation. Contracts with Interested Parties 8.02. A Conflict of Interest will not void a contract, action or transaction as long as all three of the following three conditions are met: (1) The Interested Director or Interested Officer discloses the material facts as to the relationship or interest and as to the contract, action, or transaction, or the material facts are known to the other Directors; and the Directors, can reasonably justify by the material facts to authorize the contract, action or transaction while acting in good faith.
