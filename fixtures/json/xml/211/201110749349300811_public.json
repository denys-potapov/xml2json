GENETIC RESOURCES THE JACKSON LABORATORY GENERATES AND MAINTAINS OPEN-SOURCE DATABASES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE WORLDWIDE RESEARCH COMMUNITY, DRIVING DISCOVERY IN CANCER, DIABETES, OSTEOPOROSIS, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND MANY OTHER AREAS CRITICAL TO HUMAN HEALTH. THROUGHOUT FISCAL YEAR 2010, THESE DATABASES EXPERIENCED CLOSE TO 9 MILLION \"HITS\" PER WEEK. THE LABORATORY'S MOUSE REPOSITORY OFFERED A PORTFOLIO OF OVER 2,100 TARGETED AND 1,000 TRANSGENIC MUTANT MOUSE LINES. THESE INCLUDED A WIDE SELECTION OF STRAINS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED AS MOUSE MODELS OF HUMAN DISEASES, AMONG THEM CANCER, HEART DISEASE, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, ALS, DIABETES, PARKINSON'S DISEASE, SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE AND VARIOUS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THE LABORATORY WAS AWARDED A PATENT FOR AN INNOVATION METHOD OF \"FREEZING\" GENETIC VARIATION IN LABORATORY MICE. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS WORLDWIDE TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT RANDOM CHANGE OR \"GENETIC DRIFT\" IN ITS INBRED MOUSE COLONIES. THE GENETIC STABILITY PROGRAM LITERALLY FREEZES GENETIC VARIATION IN ITS TRACKS BY REBOOTING THE PRODUCTION COLONIES WITH FROZEN EMBRYOS OR GAMETES FROM SPECIALLY PREPARED STOCKS EVERY FIVE GENERATIONS. ALSO, THE JOURNAL NATURE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE SETTING OUT AN AGENDA FOR THE WORLDWIDE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY FOR IMPROVING THE PROCESS OF SHARING DATA AND RESEARCH RESOURCES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE. IN THAT ARTICLE, THE JACKSON LABORATORY'S INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT TO DISTRIBUTING RESEARCH RESOURCES TO THE WORLDWIDE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WAS CITED AS \"AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD PRACTICE.\" BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY HELD IN ROME EARLIER THAT YEAR, THE ARTICLE ENCOURAGES SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PROCESSES AND THE REDUCTION OF PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH ACADEMIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS SHARING THEIR FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS. THE AUTHORS NOTED THAT SUCH STREAMLINED PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN STANDARD PRACTICE AT THE JACKSON LABORATORY FOR DECADES. IN EARLY 2010, A NEW EFFORT TO EXPAND RESEARCH RESOURCES DEVOTED TO FINDING A CURE FOR DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD) AND OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS. THE NEW PROGRAM IS DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING COLONIES OF THE JAX MICE DMD MODEL AND WILL IMPORT OTHER DMD MOUSE MODELS, MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO SCIENTISTS ACROSS THE NATION. THE DMD MOUSE MODELS WILL BE HOUSED WITHIN A NEW, 6,000-BOX MOUSE ROOM EXPANSION THAT IS NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION. RESEARCHERS DEVELOPING NEW CANCER THERAPIES DEPEND ON ACCESS TO PRIMARY HUMAN TUMORS. TO MEET THIS NEED, THE JACKSON LABORATORY ANNOUNCED IN APRIL OF 2010 A UNIQUE COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS (UC DAVIS) THAT CREATES A NEW CONSORTIUM AIMED AT BUILDING A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE \"LIBRARY\" OF PRIMARY HUMAN TUMORS FOR RESEARCH AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT. THE PRIMARY HUMAN TUMORS CONSORTIUM IS PROVIDING THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY WITH ACCESS TO A EXTENSIVE INVENTORY OF HUMAN TUMOR THAT VASTLY EXCEEDS WHAT ANY OTHER SINGLE INSTITUTION COULD BUILD ON ITS OWN. 4B. RESEARCH JACKSON LABORATORY RESEARCHERS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A GENE INVOLVED WITH THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE THAT COULD HOLD THE KEY TO TREATING --OR EVEN PREVENTING -- CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA (CML), A LETHAL CANCER. THE RESEARCHERS SHOWED THAT A COMBINATION OF DRUGS KNOCKED OUT CML IN MOUSE MODELS OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCHERS ATTRACTED WORLDWIDE ATTENTION IN JULY OF 2009 BY SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDING THE LIFESPAN OF AGING MICE WITH A TRANSPLANT DRUG. JACKSON LABORATORY PROFESSOR DAVID HARRISON AND COLLABORATORS REPORTED THAT RAPAMYCIN, A DRUG USED TO PREVENT ORGAN REJECTION IN HUMAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND THE LIFESPAN OF MICE. HARRISON'S TEAM FED RAPAMYCIN TO MICE LATE IN THEIR LIVES, AT 600 DAYS OF AGE. THE DRUG EXTENDED THEIR LIFESPANS BY 9 TO 14 PERCENT, MAKING RAPAMYCIN THE FIRST PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION PROVEN TO LENGTHEN MAMMALIAN LIFESPAN. A STRATEGY FOR MAKING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENTS SAFER WAS DEVELOPED BY JACKSON LABORATORY PROFESSOR GARY CHURCHILL AND COLLABORATORS, WHO IN THE FALL OF 2009 LAUNCHED A RADICAL NEW APPROACH TO TESTING THREE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS FOR POTENTIAL TOXIC EFFECTS. INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH ONE HYBRID STRAIN OF LABORATORY MOUSE, AS IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY'S PROTOCOL, THE TEAM BEGAN DEVELOPING A NEW MOUSE VARIETY THAT IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE GENETIC DIVERSITY, ENABLING RESEARCHERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND GENETIC VARIATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC REACTIONS TO CANCER DRUGS IN MICE AND HUMANS. RESEARCHERS IDENTIFIED ESSENTIAL FACTORS IN BRAIN ORGANIZATION. A RESEARCH TEAM LED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR ROBERT BURGESS SHOWED THAT TWO PROTEINS, CALLED DSCAM AND DSCAML1, ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT OF NEURONAL CIRCUITS IN THE RETINA. THIS FINDING OFFERS BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF A WIDE RANGE OF NEURO-DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS, INCLUDING DOWN SYNDROME, TOURETTE'S SYNDROME, AUTISM AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. 4C.
