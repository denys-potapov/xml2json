With today's jobs requiring specialized training and skills, the connection between having a solid education and career development has become increasingly crucial. Hero House has a good track record of initiating and developing Transitional Employment (TE). We have worked with local companies to place members on transitional employment jobs at their place of business since 2005. Through the TE program, managed by members and staff together, members are placed in paid, entry-level positions provided by participating companies. These placements are transitional in two senses: they let members ease into the world of work with a direct connection to the job, as well as on the job training and job site visits from Hero House placement managers. Typically, each placement lasts between six and nine months. The member may then move on to other placements until they are ready for a less supported job. Supported Employment (SE) combines aspects of both Transitional Employment and Independent Employment. It is designed to ease members integration into long-term jobs. While providing a direct referral from the clubhouse to the employer, as well as some initial on-job-training and assistance where it may be needed, SE is designed to offer ongoing Hero House support to members who are seeking or have moved into more permanent employment. This includes a full job search, assistance with application forms, resumes, cover letters, mock interviews, as well as accessing items needed for interviews, such as clothing. Once comfortably on the job, members are kept in touch with through employment phone reach out, monthly dinners and other supports as needed. It also provides support to the company that may initially be unsure about hiring a member for a regular job. Members with prior work experience, and/or job related education, skills and abilities as well as those who through TE complete a number of placements are encouraged to seek their own job. Hero House's Employment support helps them prepare resumes, coaches them in job search and interview techniques. Unlike TE and SE, members go on competitive interviews to get jobs gaining Independent Employment (IE). While members are working, they can continue to call on Hero House for support by phone and through a unit available to working members weekday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Job Club is held each week to assist members with becoming job ready. In Job Club Members take an active role toward moving back into the working community. Job Club helps members with writing resume's, preparing cover letters, searching for jobs, interview preparation, and overall job readiness.Hero House supports members with basic courses, geared toward supporting GED achievement, in reading, writing, math, and computers taught by Hero House members with subject matter expertise.
