Information sharing has played a vital role in progress around the region and the country.In FY 2010-11 the Association held conferences on prescription drug policy in Portland, Maine (held in conjunction with the Council of State Governments Eastern Regional Conference August 2010) and in Washington, D.C. (co-sponsored by American University's Washington College of Law, January 2011). The conferences bring together leaders from around the country to learn about the latest strategies which have worked to advance the goal of reducing prescription drug prices and making prescription drugs more affordable and accessible for all Americans, and were attended by state and national policymakers, academics, industry representatives, state and federal agency staff and consumers, as well as members of the national media. The Association staff have also participated on panels at conferences sponsored by other organizations on health care and pharmaceutical policy, in webinars and national conference calls on pharmaceutical policy.When requested, staff and board members have provided technical assistance to policymakers and legislative staff in states throughout the country and to staff for Congressional committees concerning state prescription drug policy options and best practices. Staff are also a resource for national and state-based media on pharmaceutical policy. We participated as amicus in support of state prescription drug laws being challenged in lawsuits in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. These cases addressed issues of data mining, marketing, and free speech. In collaboration with the Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property (PIJIP) at American University's Washington College of Law, the Association submitted an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Vermont's law protecting privacy and regulating data mining, in IMS v. Sorrell. The Association has provided information and fact sheets on this and other litigation to state policymakers and the media. The Association has jointly with other consumer organizations signed onto letters to the Federal Trade Commission concerning investigations into antitrust issues associated with pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), and has joined as amicus in litigation concerning the CVS/Caremark PBM.The Association maintains a website with extensive policy content and an electronic distribution list of nearly 2000 legislators and other policymakers, academics, members of the media, health industry, advocacy organizations and interested citizens from around the country. The Association has a biweekly electronic newsletter that includes policy analysis and links to relevant media reports, current state activities, model legislation and other information including statistics and research. We have a periodic blog and a Facebook page for timely updates about prescription drug policy in the news. We act as a clearinghouse for legislation and information and assist state legislators across the country to research prescription drug-related legislation and network with other legislators and academics, policymakers and activists working on these issues.Legislators from a majority of states in the country participate in our network by subscribing to our newsletter, attending our conferences, regularly contacting the staff for information or participating on our board. The current board has representation from the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Iowa and West Virginia. We are funded through state and individual dues, program registration fees, contracts and grants.", "TotalProgramServiceExpense": "72014", "DescribedIn501C3": "false", "ScheduleBRequired": "false",
