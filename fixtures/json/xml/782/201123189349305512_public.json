THE GOAL OF HNHF IS TO CREATE THRIVING SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT NURTURE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE SOUTHSIDE OF COLUMBUS SURROUNDING NCH. PROGRAMS OFFERED INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, HEALTH AND WELLNESS, EDUCATION, WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE NEIGHBORHOODS. TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT, NCH PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE AND INVESTED SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN SEED MONEY TO ALLOW THE PURCHASE OF DILAPIDATED HOUSING STOCK FOR RENOVATION AND SALE, AS WELL AS PROVIDING GRANTS TO EXISTING HOMEOWNERS FOR REPAIR. ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD PROGRAM IS NCH'S FITNESS AND NUTRITION (FAN) CLUB. FAN CLUB WAS ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S PEDIATRIC OBESITY INITIATIVE TO HELP 3RD, 4TH, AND 5TH GRADE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE FUN ACTIVITIES TO KEEP THEM FIT AND HEALTHY THROUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EDUCATION. FAN CLUB HAS INCREASED AEROBIC ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH OF PARTICIPANTS, INCREASED NUTRITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND MAINTAINED THEIR BMIS.

THIS REPORT IDENTIFIED 10 CRITICAL INDICATORS CORRESPONDNG TO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PREVENTABLE HEALTH THREATS IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY'S CHILDREN. THE INDICATORS IDENTIFIED INCLUDE: 1) ASTHMA, 2) UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES, 3) ADOLESCENT SUICIDE, 4) ADOLESCENT HOMICIDE, 5) TEEN SMOKING, 6) TEEN PREGNANCY, 7) ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, 8) INFANT MORTALITY/PRETERM BIRTH, 9) IMMUNIZATION, AND 10) OBESITY. THE 2010-2011 FULL POTENTIAL COLLABORATIVE CHILDREN'S HEALTH REPORT REVISITS ALL 10 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INDICATORS FROM THE INITIAL REPORT IN 2008 REPORT, EXAMINING CURRENT DATA, GAINING FRESH INSIGHTS FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, PROVIDING UPDATES ON SOME OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES FIRST MET TWO YEARS AGO IN THE INITIAL REPORT, AND INTRODUCING NEW FACES TO SOME OF THESE VITAL ISSUES.

ACTION IS BEING TAKEN AROUND ALL 10 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INDICATORS IDENTIFIED AS KEY BAROMETERS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH. OF THE 10 INDICATORS EXAMINED, A MORE IN-DEPTH LOOK WAS TAKEN RELATED TO CERTAIN INDICATORS. ONE AREA, PEDIATRIC OBESITY, REMAINS A LOCAL EMERGENCY, WITH BMI SCREENINGS REVEALING THAT 47 PERCENT OF FIFTH GRADERS IN COLUMBUS CITY SCHOOLS ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS TAKING ACTION. IN 2010, WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY FULL POTENTIAL PARTNERS, WITH NCH BEING A KEY PARTNER, THE HEALTHY CHOICES FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN ACT WAS PASSED IN THE STATE OF OHIO. THIS LANDMARK LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE FITNESS AND NUTRITION IN SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NCH HAS ALSO TAKEN A LEADERSHIP POSITION ELIMINATING SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES FOR SALE OR PROVIDED WITH PATIENT MEALS ON ITS CAMPUS. OTHER WAYS NCH SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THIS INDICATOR IS THROUGH MEDICAL SERVICES, COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, POLICY INITIATIVES AND EMPLOYEE WELLNESS PROGRAMS. NCH'S CENTER FOR HEALTHY WEIGHT AND NUTRITION OFFERS FAMILIES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER HAS PROGRAMS FOR BOTH THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OVERWEIGHT CHILDREN. IT PARTNERS WITH THE YMCA AND BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. IT ALSO WORKS WITH PHYSICIANS TO IMPLEMENT THE OUNCE OF PREVENTION PROGRAM TO PARENTS, PROVIDING A STEPWISE APPROACH TO ESTABLISHING HEALTHFUL FOOD AND ACTIVITY HABITS EARLY IN LIFE. IN ADDITION, THE CENTER PROVIDES MULTIDISCIPLINARY LIFESTYLE PROGRAMS FOR INTENSIVE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. ANOTHER INDICATOR ADDRESSED RELATES TO PRETERM BIRTH. PRETERM BIRTH REMAINS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF INFANT DEATHS IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES ARE STILL HIGHER IN FRANKLIN COUNTY THAN OHIO OR THE U.S.; HOWEVER, THE COLLABORATIVE OHIO BETTER BIRTH OUTCOMES INITIATIVE (OBBO) IS TACKLING THE ISSUE THROUGH A SERIES OF PROVEN INTERVENTIONS WITH HIGH RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WHICH ARE ALREADY STARTING TO IMPROVE THE NUMBERS AROUND PREMATURITY. THROUGH ITS PROGRAMS, OBBO HAS ACHIEVED, TO DATE: * A 50 PERCENT REDUCTION IN PRETERM BIRTHS FOR WOMEN INVOLVED IN ITS NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP INTERVENTION PROGRAM * A 45 PERCENT REDUCTION IN LATE PRETERM BIRTHS WITHOUT MEDICAL INDICATIONS THROUGH ITS CENTRAL OHIO SCHEDULED BIRTHS INITIATIVE * AN INCREASE OF AN AVERAGE THREE TO FOUR WEEKS GESTATION FOR BABIES BORN TO HIGH-RISK MOTHERS RECEIVING \"17P\" HORMONE TREATMENT * AN INCREASE IN PRENATAL CARE SLOTS FOR NEWLY PREGNANT LOW-INCOME WOMEN OF 20 PERCENT IN 2011, THROUGH THE COMBINED IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS, OBBO IS ON TRACK TO REDUCE 9,000 NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (NICU) DAYS IN FRANKLIN COUNTY BY THE END OF THE YEAR. IMMUNIZATION IS ALSO A PREVENTABLE HEALTH THREAT IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY'S CHILDREN. THERE'S STILL A WIDE DISPARITY IN IMMUNIZATION RATES BETWEEN THE URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS OF OUR COUNTY. TO HELP ADDRESS THIS NCH IS HOLDING SEASONAL FLU VACCINATION CLINICS AT EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT THIS YEAR.
