The primary goal of Martin's Point is to help our patients and members live healthier lives. We achieve this through our commitment to provide the best possible health care experience to those we serve, offering clinical excellence in care, and treating them with warmth and concern. Working in partnership with our patients and members, we help them take an active role in making good health choices and ultimately living happier and healthier lives. More specifically, we care for our communities in three primary ways: 1.) by providing high-quality primary care and selected specialty and ancillary services to patients at 8 locations throughout Maine and 1 location in New Hampshire, including onsite pharmacy, radiology, and lab services at many locations; 2.) by administering Military and Medicare Advantage health insurance plans; and 3.) by making positive improvements that help transform the health care system in the communities we serve and that can also serve as models of improved care beyond our communities, statewide and nationally. PROVIDING HIGH-QUALITY PRIMARY CARE In 2010, Martin's Point Health Care: - Finished construction of a new state-of-the-art health care center at our flagship location in Portland, ME. The new health center is a LEED certified building and was opened to the public on November 15, 2010. - Expanded health care access through the addition of 10 primary care and specialty providers. In this year, over 65,000 patients received care in the areas of family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, cardiology, general surgery, sports medicine, cosmetic dermatology, physical therapy, and more. Many patients were also able to take advantage of onsite radiology, pharmacy, and laboratory services. - Provided more than $225,000 of medical services free-of-charge to patients with insufficient coverage. - Offered health education programs on a broad range of topics including smoking cessation, diabetes control, and weight management to the public, often free of charge. - Began piloting a new model of care where physicians and other medical staff are grouped into \"care teams\". Through this team set-up, they are able to more effectively work together to anticipate patients' needs, better coordinate their care, and help create better health outcomes and experiences. PROVIDING HEALTH AND WELLNESS PLANS FOR MEMBERS Martin's Point offers health care plans for select groups throughout the Northeast. Our plan members receive comprehensive benefits and quality care, and they consistently give us high ratings for exemplary service and satisfaction. In 2010, Martin's Point Health Care: - Served as one of six contracted health plan administrators to the Department of Defense of the US Family Health Plan for military beneficiaries. Through this plan, Martin's Point serves families of active-duty personnel, including activated National Guard and Reserve, military retirees and their families across northern New England, Upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania. In 2010, our US Family Health Plan served over 33,000 members. In our 30 years of providing this TRICARE Prime option, we consistently have earned high marks for customer service and member satisfaction. - Provided a Medicare Advantage insurance plan, which served close to 7,000 Maine residents in all 16 counties in 2010. This plan was recognized as being among a select group of plans nationally that earned a 4 or 5 star rating from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Martin's Point rating of 4.5 stars put our plan in the top 6% of Medicare plans nationwide. 2010 marked the second year in a row that Martin's Point had the highest rated Medicare Advantage plan in Maine. - Provided a suite of wellness, care management, and plan administrative services to self-insured employers throughout the state of Maine. COMMITTED TO TRANSFORMING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Martin's Point is leading the way to transforming the health care system in the communities we serve and beyond. We are dedicated to participating in and creating opportunities to share innovative solutions with others towards our common goal of creating a sustainable, quality health care delivery system, both in Maine and throughout the nation. Our work is driven by three principles: 1) to improve the experience of care, 2) to improve health outcomes, and 3) to reduce overall costs. To achieve these goals, we are working to make systemic changes to the way primary care is delivered and coordinated. In 2010, Martin's Point Health Care: - Served as an active participant in the Maine State Regional Health Information Exchange, HealthInfoNet, which holds vital patient information on over 50% of the State's population. - Continued to enhance our primary care comprehensive payment model to encourage and reward quality care and a better health care experience. - Served as one of the first 40 international prototyping organizations for the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim Initiative. - Participated as a member of the national Alliance of Community Health Plans, comprised of 20 of the top performing community and regional non-profit health plans. MARTIN'S POINT - MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY Martin's Point is committed to making a difference and improving lives in the communities we serve. In addition to doing this through our services for patients and members, the organization also serves as a leader in the philanthropic community. In 2010, Martin's Point Health Care: - Contributed $300,000 in financial support to more than 90 health care and community nonprofit organizations, agencies, and groups throughout Maine, New Hampshire, and New York. - Hosted three health care education events called the Martin's Point Innovators Series. These events attract hundreds of health care leaders and professionals throughout Maine and New England to interact with and listen to nationally recognized health care experts who share and discuss ideas, cutting-edge practices, and health care trends. - Employees personally and collectively contributed over $55,000 of their wages to their local United Ways and other charities. - Employees from across the organization also actively volunteered their own time to represent Martin's Point Health Care in significant fundraising events for the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, Maine Cancer Foundation, Maine Lung Association, Northeast Passage, and many more. Martin's Point is proud to support our employees in their efforts and ability to make a difference in our communities. Thus, Martin's Point provides a volunteer time-off policy which makes it easier for our employees to do direct volunteer service and serve on community boards and committees. In addition, Martin's Point donates monetary support to charitable organizations and efforts in which our employees are engaged."}, {"Identifier": "Form 990, Part VI, Section B, line 11", "Explanation": "The Form 990 is prepared internally with assistance from an outside CPA firm.
