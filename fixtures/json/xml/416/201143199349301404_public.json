THE MANUAL INCLUDES CONFIDENTIALITY AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES, WHICH ARE ALSO REVIEWED PERIODICALLY IN AGENCY STAFF MEETINGS. DURING 2010, FRANNIE PEABODY CENTER DID NOT HAVE A WRITTEN WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY, BUT FOLLOWED THE GUIDANCE OF THE FEDERAL WHISTLEBLOWERS' PROTECTION ACT. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO STAFF THROUGH POSTED NOTICES IN COMMON AREAS AT ALL AGENCY LOCATIONS. IN MARCH, 2011, FRANNIE PEABODY CENTER REVISED ITS CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY TO A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INCLUDING BOARD MEMBERS, MANAGEMENT, AND STAFF. AT THAT TIME, THE AGENCY ALSO ADOPTED A FORMAL WRITTEN EMPLOYEE PROTECTION (WHISTLEBLOWER) POLICY. STAFF RECIEVED ORIENTATION ON AND COPIES OF THIS POLICY AT THE APRIL 2011 STAFF MEETING. AT THAT TIME, THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DOCUMENT IN WRITING THAT THEY RECEIVED THE POLICY. NEW HIRES AFTER APRIL, 2011, RECIEVE THE REVISED CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND EMPLOYEE PROTECTION POLICIES AS PART OF THEIR NEW HIRE PACKETS AND ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN THE RECEIPT ACKOWLEDGEMENTS. THE AGENCY INTENDS TO INCORPORATE THESE INTO ITS POLICY AND PROCEDURES MANUAL AT ITS NEXT REVISION, CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR EARLY 2012. AS NOTED ABOVE, FRANNIE PEABODY CENTER HAS FORMAL WRITTEN CONFIDENTIALITY POLICIES WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THE PROGRAM EVALUATOR. EMPLOYEES AND PROGRAM VOLUNTEERS ARE TRAINED ON THESE POLICIES AT HIRE AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER DURING HIPAA (HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996) PRIVACY AND SECURITY TRAINING. EMPLOYEES AND PROGRAM VOLUNTEERS ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN STATEMENTS OF CONFIDENTIALITY AT EACH OF THESE TRAININGS. THE CONFIDENTIALITY POLICIES INCLUDE COMPLIANCE WITH AGENCY PROCEDURES FOR CONFIDENTIAL DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS. THE AGENCY CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL WRITTEN DOCUMENTS STORAGE AND DESTRUCTION SCHEDULE FOR AGENCY RECORDS, ALTHOUGH LOGS OF MATERIALS IN STORAGE ARE MAINTAINED. THE AGENCY FOLLOWS HIPAA AND MAINE DHHS GUIDELINES FOR DESTRUCTION OF CLIENT RECORDS, AND IS CONTINUING TO WORK WITH FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING SOURCES TO COORDINATE THEIR SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS STORAGE AND CONFIDENTIAL DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS INTO A COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN PROGRAM FOR THE AGENCY. EXTERNAL VENDORS AND OTHERS WHO VISIT PROGRAM LOCATIONS ARE PROVIDED, AT ENTRY, WITH THE STATEMENT OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN IT PRIOR TO ACCESSING ANY LOCATION. AGENCY DIRECTORS RECEIVE COPIES OF THE BYLAWS AND DIRECTOR POLICIES, INCLUDING THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY (AS OF MARCH 2011). THEY ARE ALSO PROVIDED HIPAA PRIVACY AND SECURITY TRAINING WHEN THEY JOIN THE BOARD; AT THAT TIME THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN STATEMENTS OF CONFIDENTIALITY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO ATTENDS ANNUAL HIPAA TRAINING AND SIGNS NEW STATEMENTS OF CONFIDENTIALITY AT THAT TIME. DURING 2010 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DID NOT HAVE A FORMAL WRITTEN POLICY REGARDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, NOR DID IT REQUIRE DIRECTORS TO DISCLOSE ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. BOARD MEMBERS ARE SCREENED BY A NOMINATING COMMITTEE AND THEN INTERVIEWED AND VOTED ON BY THE FULL BOARD. DURING THAT PROCESS INQUIRIES ARE MADE REGARDING ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. ALSO, THE AGENCY BYLAWS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT COMPENSATION TO DIRECTORS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXPECTS ITS MEMBERS TO NOTIFY THE BOARD PRESIDENT AS SOON AS ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICT ARISES. THE BOARD RESOOLVES CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. SEVERAL CURRENT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE EXISTING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (PRIMARILY DUE TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT) WHICH ARE KNOWN TO THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT.
