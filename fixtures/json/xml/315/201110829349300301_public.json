One goal for individuals receiving these services is to live as independently as possible in the community and to improve their quality of life. CSI provides three levels of care in the community support program: community integration, assertive community treatment and community rehabilitation services. All of the services are community based. Assertive community treatment is a multi-disciplinary team approach which includes nursing, psychiatry, substance abuse services, vocational services, therapy and case management services. Community integration services include supportive counseling and case management services. Community rehabilitation services are offered in two locations, North Berwick and Biddeford. At these sites individuals live in independent apartments which are supervised 12 hours a day and have staff on call 24/7. Providing these levels of care along with a clinical team approach allows for an easy transition down or up from one level of care to another without the disruption, duplication, and cost of changing providers. These services provide a safety net of care, often avoiding hospitalization.
