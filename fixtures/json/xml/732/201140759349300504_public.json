Part I, Line 2", "Explanation": "The U.S. Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (\"USRF\") undertakes a rigorous review process for all grants made to organizations outside the United States. Any organization seeking funding from USRF is required to complete a grant or funding application that is reviewed by a member of the senior staff who then determines if it addresses the charitable missions supported by USRF. If a Foundation grant application is determined to be worthy of support, it is will be recommended for approval to the Grants Committee in the case it is less than $100,000 and to the full Board in the case it is more than $100,000. Once a grant request is approved, a contract is developed between USRF and the grantee. The grant documentation makes clear the responsibilities of all parties. It obligates the grantee to use the grant funds only for the purposes for which the grant is made, provides for periodic written reports as well as an accounting of how grant funds were used, and acknowledges the Organization's authority to withhold or recover grant funds in cases where such funds are, or appear to be, misused. To ensure that the foreign organizations receiving funds are using the funds in furtherance of our exempt mission, USRF will make site visits, participate in grantee events, or review relevant research papers. USRF provides oversight to each grantee. 1. A grant manager is assigned to each grantee. 2. There is extensive interaction with grantee on the development of its proposal to ensure that grant funds will only be used for purposes agreed upon. 3. Contracts are signed that outline how the grant funds will be used 4. Periodic reports are required to ensure that milestones are reached 5. Grant Manager will make site visit 6.
