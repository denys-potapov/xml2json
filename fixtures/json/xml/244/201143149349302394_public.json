MUSEUM, A PRIMARILY VOLUNTEER NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, IS THE OPERATING ENTITY OF THE NEW ENGLAND ELECTRIC RAILWAY HISTORICAL SOCIETY. THE MISSION OF THE MUSEUM IS TO PRESENT A LIVING HISTORY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RELEVANT TO NORTH AMERICAN LIFE THROUGH COMMUNITY-RELATED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THE MUSEUM SHALL COLLECT, RESTORE, PRESERVE, EXHIBIT AND DEMONSTRATE THE OPERATION OF SIGNIFICANT TRANSIT VEHICLES WITH EMPHASIS UPON TRADITIONAL STREETCAR AND INTERURBAN SERVICE, INCLUDING RAPID TRANSIT, TRACKLESS TROLLEY AND BUS SERVICE WITH SELECT WORLDWIDE COMPARATIVE REPRESENTATION. THE MUSEUM SHALL PROVIDE A REPOSITORY FOR ARTIFACTS AND INFORMATION OF AN EDUCATIONAL AND HISTORICAL NATURE RELATING TO THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO MODERN SOCIETY.", "SignificantNewProgramServices": "0", "SignificantChange": "0", "Expense": "455736", "Revenue": "219936", "Description": "IN 2010, AS IN PAST YEARS, THE NEW ENGLAND ELECTRIC RAILWAY HISTORICAL SOCIETY, OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF THE SEASHORE TROLLEY MUSEUM AND THE NATIONAL STREETCAR MUSEUM IN LOWELL [MASSACHUSETTS] HAS CONTINUED TO CARRY OUT ITS PRIMARY MISSION OF COLLECTING, RESTORING, PRESERVING, EXHIBITING AND OPERATING TRANSIT VEHICLES, INCLUDING CITY STREETCARS, INTERURBAN CARS AND RAPID TRANSIT CARS, AS WELL AS BUSES AND TRACKLESS TROLLEYS.WE WERE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ON WEEKENDS IN MAY AND LATE OCTOBER, AND EVERY DAY FROM MEMORIAL DAY TO COLUMBUS DAY IN MAINE. IN LOWELL WE ARE OPEN WEEKENDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND SOME THURSDAYS AND FRIDAYS, WITH THE MUSEUMS CAR OPERATING ON WEEKENDS FROM MAY TO OCTOBER. EVERY ELECTRIC STREETCAR OR INTERURBAN CAR IN OUR OPERATING FLEET IS AN AUTHENTIC TRANSIT VEHICLE, SOMETIMES OVER 100 YEARS OLD, AND ARE SUBJECT TO SERVICING AND CAREFUL INSPECTION BEFORE BEING RELEASED FOR PUBLIC SERVICE ON OUR 1.7 MILE LONG DEMONSTRATION RAILWAY. AS THE FLEET OF CARS BEING OPERATED FOR THE PUBLIC COMPRISES OF HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS, THE PROBLEMS INEVITABLY ENCOUNTERED WITH ELDERLY EQUIPMENT TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN. RESTORATION OF HISTORICAL STREETCARS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT STRENGTH OF THE ORGANIZATION. A SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN 2010 WAS THE COMPLETION OF THE RESTORATION OF NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT WOODEN BOX CAR NO. 1160, A VERY TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND STREETCAR. ITS RESTORATION WAS UNDERWRITTEN BY A VERY GENEROUS PROJECT SPONSOR WITH MANY OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEMBERS AND FRIENDS OF THE SOCIETY. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WAS ALSO MADE BY STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS ON RESTORATION OF EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS STREET RAILWAY LIGHTWEIGHT CAR 7005, WASHINGTON (DC) PCC 1304, PHILADELPHIA NEARSIDE 6618, AND DENVER BIRNEY 1, AND BOSTON CENTER ENTRANCE CAR 6131, WITH MEASURABLE PROGRESS MADE ON THE RESTORATION OR MAINTENANCE OF NUMEROUS OTHER STREETCARS, RAPID TRANSIT CARS, TRACKLESS TROLLEYS, AND BUSES.THE MUSEUM ALSO LENT ITS EXPERTISE TO SUPPORT RESTORATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVED STREETCAR IN SAN FRANCISCO, A CITY ASSOCIATED WITH URBAN RAIL TRANSPORTATION BY VISITORS WORLDWIDE. THE CITYS TRANSIT AGENCY CONTRACTED WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA FIRM OF BROOKVILLE EQUIPMENT TO COMPLETELY REBUILD MUNICIPAL RAILWAY CAR 1 OF 1911. BROOKVILLE THE SUBCONTRACTED WITH THE MUSEUM TO BUILD A COMPLETE NEW SET OF RATTAN COVERED SEATS FOR THE CAR, AS THE MUSEUM POSSESSES THE UNIQUE SKILLS TO FABRICATE SUCH SEATS IN AN AUTHENTIC MANNER. THE FUNDS GENERATED BY THIS CONTRACT HELPED SUSTAIN THE MUSEUMS UNRESTRICTED FUND.SPECIAL EVENTS DURING 2010 INCLUDED OUR ALWAYS POPULAR PUMPKIN PATCH DURING TWO WEEKENDS IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY OCTOBER, A BUS AND RAPID TRANSIT EVENT ON COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND, A CHRISTMAS PRELUDE CELEBRATION IN EARLY DECEMBER, AND ANNUAL MEETING AND MEMBERS DAY EVENTS FOR OUR MEMBERS. EACH OF THESE EVENTS ARE DESIGNED TO SHOWCASE OUR SUBSTANTIAL COLLECTION OF BUSES, TRACKLESS TROLLEYS AND RAPID TRANSIT CARS.THE SOCIETY HAS A PARTS DEPARTMENT THAT IS ORGANIZED TO ESTABLISH, HOUSE, CATALOGUE AND SECURE A STOREHOUSE OF RARE AND UNOBTAINABLE SPARE PARTS TO OPERATE, MAINTAIN, AND RESTORE THE VEHICLE COLLECTIONS. IN ADDITION, PARTS THAT ARE SURPLUS TO THE SOCIETYS PRESENT AND FUTURE NEEDS ARE TRADED OR SOLD TO OTHER MUSEUMS AND TO SOME OPERATING TRANSIT AUTHORITIES TO ASSIST IN THEIR NEEDS. REVENUE FROM THESE SALES IS USED TO OBTAIN FURTHER NEEDED PARTS AND TO FUND THE ACQUISITION AND OPERATION OF MATERIAL HANDLING AND RAILWAY MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT. BESIDES RIDING AUTHENTICALLY RESTORED TROLLEY CARS, OUR 18,000 MAINE VISITORS IN 2010 HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT AND PHOTOGRAPH OVER TWENTY OTHER CARS IN THREE EXHIBIT BARNS. WHEN SUFFICIENT VOLUNTEER STAFF IS AVAILABLE, A TROLLEY RUNS ON A SHORT SHUTTLE TRIP TO THE LARGEST OF THESE BARNS, AND/OR A DOCENT GIVES GUIDED TOURS OF THE EXHIBITS ON DISPLAY. AS WELL, VISITORS MAY LITERALLY OVERSEE THE RESTORATION WORK IN PROGRESS IN OUR SHOP VIA A VISITORS GALLERY. IN OUR VISITORS CENTER THERE IS A DISPLAY ROOM THAT TELLS THE STORY OF THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY INDUSTRY WHICH A CENTURY AGO WAS THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. THIS EXHIBIT IS FOCUSED AROUND THE RESTORATION COMPLETED IN 2009 OF ATLANTIC SHORE LINE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE 100, A PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED AN EXTENSIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM AND WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE OF MAINES ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION ENHANCEMENT FUNDS.THE MUSEUMS GRANTS COMMITTEE IS PREPARING APPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER SUCH TRANSPORTATION ENHANCEMENT FUNDING FOR A SUBSEQUENT EDUCATIONAL AND RESTORATION PROGRAM FOCUSING ON PORTLAND-LEWISTON WOODEN INTERURBAN CAR NO. 14, THE NARCISSUS.DURING THE YEAR THE MUSEUM HOSTED ITS SECOND TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE. THIS WAS DRIVEN IN PART BY THE MUSEUMS PARTICIPATION IN MAINES STEM (SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY-ENGINEERING-MATH) INITIATIVE, WHICH IS TRYING TO ENSURE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THE TECHNICAL SKILLS NEEDED BY TODAYS SOCIETY. THE MUSEUM IS DRAWING ON ITS EXTENSIVE TECHNICAL RESOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION IN PROVIDING TEACHERS WITH AN ARRAY OF ONLINE TEACHING RESOURCES INCLUDING CURRICULAR MATERIALS.THIS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM DRAWS ON PART OF OUR MISSION WHICH IS TO PROVIDE A REPOSITORY FOR ARTIFACTS AND INFORMATION OF AN EDUCATIONAL AND HISTORICAL NATURE RELATING TO THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO MODERN SOCIETY. WE HAVE A DEDICATED AND VERY ACTIVE GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS IN THIS AREA, WHO HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN ORGANIZING OUR VAST COLLECTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS AND ASSOCIATED ARTIFACTS, AND MOVING SOME OF IT TO SAFER STORAGE. OUR PRESENT LIBRARY FACILITY CAN PERHAPS BE BEST DESCRIBED AS RAMSHACKLE, AND SO OUR LIBRARY VOLUNTEERS ARE ACTIVELY DRAWING UP PLANS FOR A NEW FACILITY, WITH INDISPENSIBLE HELP FROM AN ARCHITECT WHO IS DONATING HIS SERVICES. IN THE MEAN TIME DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS ARE ELECTRONICALLY SCANNING AND CATALOGUING THE COLLECTION, WITH GREAT COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE FROM THE NEARBY YORK COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE.AS THE MUSEUM IN MAINE HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR SOME 71 YEARS, MAINTENANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS AN ISSUE OF GROWING IMPORTANCE. IN 2009 SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE PRIMARY DISPLAY BUILDING, HIGHWOOD CARHOUSE. IN 2010 A SIMILAR EFFORT TO REPAIR AND STRENGTHEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE FAIRVIEW CARHOUSE WAS UNDERTAKEN AND CONTINUES INTO 2011.", "TotalProgramServiceExpense": "455736",
