Mercy Hospital and the City of Portland's Public Health Department. Clinic patients are predominantly individuals without insurance, including individuals who are ineligible for Medicaid (MaineCare). In 2010, Mercy provided cash subsidization of approximately $180,000 to the Clinic, not including volunteer hours. During calendar year 2010, Free Clinic statistics were as follow: 558 patients were seen; there were 1910 individual visits. Mercy Hospital is the preferred referral provider for patients of the Portland Free Clinic for hospital admissions, diagnostic testing and laboratory work. There were a total of 95 non-English speaking patient encounters in 2010; with the largest group speaking Spanish.- Mercy is also home to the state's largest behavioral health provider, the Mercy Recovery Center (MRC). MRC is staffed with 65 full time employees, including Physicians, Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Specialists, Administrators and Program Support personnel. The MRC provides approximately $1,000,000 in free care annually to about 700 patients without insurance.- Mercy is an active participant on the Cumberland District Public Health Council of which Colleen Hilton, Executive Director of Mercy's VNA Home Health & Hospice division, is the Executive Director. - Additional Participation on Community Boards and Committees by Mercy staff includes (but is not limited to): Portland's Community Police Advisory Board; Maine Health Management Coalition; St. Joseph's College, Daniel Hanley Center for Health Leadership, Maine Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, Portland Stage Company, Park Danforth, Synernet, Greater Portland Landmarks, community health fairs; and volunteering for community health events such as Legs for Life and others.Addressing the Needs of the Multicultural Community: - Mercy interpreter services for consumers and families who interact with Mercy are being improved through Mercy's participation in a Robert Wood Johnson funded, Aligning Forces for Quality, language improvement collaborative. By providing a trained medical interpreter for all patients with a language barrier, both the quality and safety of multicultural patients' experience with the healthcare system is enhanced.- Mercy Hospital offers free English as a Second Language, ESL classes, to all volunteers, community members and employees.- In 2010, Mercy participated in the City of Portland's 5th Annual Multicultural Exercise for Health and Love, during which Mercy provided screening services and health counseling. Portland Area Residential Services Consortium: Mercy Hospital has convened the Portland Area Residential Services Consortium (PARC) and developed a community-based residential model to serve as an alternative to the traditional, bundled, 28-day residential treatment model for patients that battle substance abuse. The traditional model is not cost effective, and as a result, beds are expensive and of limited availability. The PARC project has two goals: 1) to increase residential treatment capacity in greater Portland and 2) to develop a client-centric, cost-effective and sustainable program using the elements of the collaborative, community-based residential model. Through collaboration among agencies that already offer services that our clients need, we can provide unbundled, individualized treatment services, thereby reducing cost and increasing efficiency.The PARC model is safe, sober housing with outpatient substance abuse treatment services; case management and referral; a web-based shared medical record, and peer support and navigation. Treatment for all clients begins with two key elements: therapy-based intensive outpatient treatment from a substance abuse agency, and safe housing in a supported sober living environment. The homes are staffed 24-hours a day with a knowledgeable Case Manager, called a Care Coordinator . The length of stay at sober houses is flexible, with a goal for every client to discharge to an appropriate transitional, supported, and/or permanent housing situation.Secondly, instead of creating an artificial treatment environment that disappears on discharge day, the clients are provided with resources and life skills for healthier, long-term functionality. Care Coordinators make referrals, help clients navigate community services, assist with transportation, and provide milieu support. During 2010, the program served 35 patients and expects to serve 75 patients in year one of operation. The Advisory Committee is a group of community stakeholders who meet bimonthly to advise the PARC project. Its function is to: 1) serve as a public relations forum; 2) identify unmet needs in the community; 3) engage stakeholders; 4) assist in strategic planning for the next three years; 5) advocate for the initiative; 6) insure sustainability; and 7) network (connect to other organizations, initiatives and funding). Mercy also provides supportive services that lie outside these descriptions, and enhance our non-profit profile. McAuley Residence:McAuley Residence is Mercy Hospital's transitional housing program for women. The residents may have their children live with them at McAuley Residence. It is currently located across the street from the Mercy Hospital State Street Campus, in the heart of Portland. The 24-month program serves needy women and their children primarily from southern Maine, but some may come from other parts of the state. The program's mission is to provide an empowering environment where a woman can gain stability, build life skills, develop goals, and lead a more meaningful, holistic life. At McAuley Residence, the residents have access to clinical staff and a diverse group of providers, to help them gain a solid foothold in society. Most women who come to the program have been abused at one time, and are recovering from addiction, are homeless, have no savings, no job, have not completed their education, have not had recent medical or dental care, and have little knowledge about available resources. In the past 22 years, McAuley Residence has served over 200 women and children.Gary's House (Hospitality House): Gary's House is a hospitality home for families of patients undergoing medical treatment in Portland area hospitals. Founded by Mercy Hospital in 1998, Gary's House provides a supportive and economical ($15 per night) home away from home at a time of great stress. In 2010, 474 families were served and an elevator was added in 2009 to ensure that guests with mobility concerns can stay comfortably at Gary's House.Global Health Ministry: Global Health Ministry is an independent 501(c)(3) organization sponsored by Hope Ministries and serves as a supportive health corporation of Catholic Health East of which Mercy Health System of Maine is a member. Each year Mercy Hospital encourages clinical and non-clinical employees to participate in a missionary trip to one of Global Health Ministry's sites to provide healthcare services and education. Since 1989, Global Health Ministry has sent teams of healthcare professionals to provincial villages and distressed urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean to help people with little or no access to professional healthcare. Founded as Global Outreach, today's Global Health Ministry has served thousands of people through the dedicated work of hundreds of volunteers. Mission site development includes: Chulucanas, Peru; Esquipulas, Guatemala; Port au Prince, Haiti, and Kingston, Jamaica. In response to the devastation in Haiti, Mercy Hospital donated medical supplies and equipment that was picked up by the International Medical Equipment Collaborative and transported via container ship to Haiti. Mercy employees also donated funds to the American Red Cross and to Konbit Sante Cap-Haitien Health Partnership, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit corporation organized in the State of Maine. Konbit Sante's mission is to support the development of a sustainable health care system to meet the needs of the Cap-Haitien community with maximum local direction and support."}, {"Explanation": "Part III, Line 4: Mercy Hospital provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness of patients or third-party payors to make payments for services. The allowance is determined by analyzing historical data and trends. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when managment determines that recovery is unlikely and refers collection efforts to a third-party collector under contract. Recoveries of bad debt write-offs reduce bad debt expense. The costing methodology used for determining Mercy Hospital's bad debt expense at cost is applying a cost to charge ratio on the value of the organizations bad debt expense. To determine the estimated amount of bad debt expense (at cost) attributable to patients eligible under the organizations's charity care policy, the calculated percentage of total charity care to total gross patient revenue was applied to the total bad debt expense. The resulting amount was multiplied by the Medicare cost to charge ratio. Although our charity care policies and procedures make every effort to indentify thoses patients who are eligible for charity care before the billing process begins, often it is not possible to make an appropriate determination until after the billing and collection cycle has commenced. The rationale for including bad debt amounts in community benefits would be to account for those patients who were classified as bad debt expense, but would have qualified for charity care if sufficient information had been availiable to make a determination of their eligibility.Discounts on patient accounts are not considered to be bad debts."}, {"Explanation": "Part III, Line 8: The costing methodology to determine Mercy Hopsital's Medicare shortfall is calculated by applying a cost-to-charge ratio on the value of gross Medicare revenue to determine an estimate of total revenue received from Medicare and comparing this amount to allowable costs of care."}, {"Explanation": "Part III, Line 9b: Mercy Hospital's written debt collection policy clearly states that patients who are known to qualify for charity care or financial assistance are covered under Mercy Hospital's charity care policy. The charity care policy outlines specific parameters for collection practices for charity care patients."}, {"Explanation": "Part VI, Line 2: Aligning community services using community identified health indicators:Mercy Hospital works to align our services with the health needs of the community by using the health indicators listed in the Community Health Profile for Cumberland County, annual data provided by Portland's Public Health Division, and a comprehensive asset map and analysis provided by Catholic Health East. These health indicators are as follows: Health Status; Access to Health Care; Physical Activity; Asthma; Tobacco Use; Diabetes; Nutrition; Hypertension; Overweight and Obesity; Mammogram; Medical Care Costs; Pap Smear, Alcohol/Drug Abuse, and Safety/Security/ Domestic Violence. The indicators targeted by Mercy's outreach efforts include: (1) Access to Health Care; (2) Alcohol/Drug Abuse; (3) Health Status; (4) Medical Care Costs.; (5) Nutrition.; and (6) Diabetes.The following are examples of Mercy Hospital community services and the relevant community health indicator: (1) Access to Health Care - Portland Free Clinic, Wellness Clinics, Volunteer Services, School of Radiology, Community Health Outreach Workers (CHOW), Mercy's OB Clinic, and Interpreter's Training Sponsorship; (2) Alcohol/Drug Abuse - HOME Team and Portland's Area Regional Consortium Advisory Board; (3) Health Status - Cancer Support Groups, Pastoral Care-Hospice Visits, McAuley Residence and Hearts to Souls Event; (4) Medical Care Costs - Portland Free Clinic, Advanced Patient Advocacy, McAuley Residence, and Community Health Outreach Worker Training; (5) Nutrition - Nutrition Education and Counseling and \"Cooking for One\" Class; and (6) Diabetes - Diabetes Self-Management Education Program.HOME Team:Chronically homeless persons in Portland use an inordinate amount of resources without benefit of improved health status or overall quality of life. Many of these homeless individuals end up in hospital emergency departments and the Cumberland County Jail at great cost to the local municipalities and state. In July 2010, the HOME Team - Mobile Van Unit with Street Intervention Workers - was launched to engage chronically homeless individuals in services that will get them off the streets and into safe, stabilized situations. By going to the streets and reaching out directly to this group, the HOME Team has formed relationships, identified unmet social service needs, and made appropriate referrals to community programs. Through active assessment, intervention and referral services, the team has guided these individuals to the appropriate services by accessing the current service delivery system and has markedly reduced the number of contacts with Portland Police and Fire and Rescue. An analysis from July 2010 through December 2010 showed that the HOME Team had 5192 contacts during the six months of operation or roughly 200 contacts per week. The team achieved a 10% reduction in Emergency Department visits at Mercy Hospital and a 30% reduction at Maine Medical Center for this target population. The data also suggests a significant drop in the number of police responses to high frequency users who were passed out on the street. It should be noted that police policy changed in May of 2010 as to when they would respond to calls for service involving layouts. Given the resources of the HOME Team, police no longer respond to initial calls, they do respond if they receive a second call. Even when controlling for this change in police policy, the data suggests an 82 percent drop in police responses to calls for individuals who were passed out on the street.Community Health Outreach Workers:Through a partnership with the City of Portland, Mercy employs two Community Health Outreach Workers (CHOW) to assist with community outreach and care navigation for patients with diverse backgrounds. The Latino CHOW works primarily at the Portland Community Free Clinic coordinating care and assisting patients with access to follow up care with a Mercy provider or specialist. The Somali CHOW works in Mercy's Fore River Family Practice and manages a case load of patients, ensuring that patients with chronic disease or behavioral health concerns successfully navigate the system of care. Both of the CHOWs provide necessary translation of documents or flyers.Mattina R. Proctor Diabetes Center:The Diabetes Self-Management Education Program (DSME) at Mercy Hospital assists persons with diabetes in acquiring the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to achieve and maintain good diabetes control. DSME is offered in group or individual sessions that include general DSME, insulin initiation/adjustment, self blood glucose management, gestational diabetes counseling, and insulin pump therapy. The target audience is newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed adults with diabetes, which includes Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes and their significant others. Both the nurse and dietician conduct an individual needs assessment with each client and clients attending group classes have a post-assessment interview within one month of completing the classes. A follow-up group is offered monthly continuing for up to one year. Education services for patients are scheduled at intervals based on individual needs and assessment of health status, knowledge, skills, and attitudes, behavioral goal achievement, and post-partum clinical outcomes. Education materials are offered in various languages and literacy levels. A detailed follow up plan for each patient is communicated to the referring provider. Our professional staff includes an Endocrinologist Medical Director, Nurse Manager, RN Clinical Dietician, and RN Diabetes Educator.Mercy's OB Clinic:In 2010, the Mercy Hospital OB Clinic provided low risk prenatal care for 927 patients; many of whom have diverse backgrounds and limited English proficiency. The clinic is open two days per week and staffed with Nurse Midwives and Professional Nurses. Staff administers a psycho-social assessment to include a risk assessment for domestic violence, nutritional screens, prenatal lab work, adolescent screens for young women under 18 years of age and add appropriate supports to foster safe and healthy delivery. Referrals occur from the community and primary care physicians. Mercy's School of Radiology:In partnership with Southern Maine Community College, Mercy Hospital offers a two-year associates degree program in radiologic technology with didactic and clinical training. Clinical sites include all of Mercy Hospital locations that offer x-ray services and Maine Medical Center for specific training in certain aspects of clinical competency. The program graduates eight to ten students annually that are well prepared for the radiologic technology examination boards. This program supports the need for skilled technicians in new urgent care sites, expanded Emergency Departments, cardiac catheterization and vascular intervention labs and expanding mammography sites throughout the State of Maine.Mercy's Volunteer Program:In 2010, over 477 volunteers gave of their skills, time and energy to our healthcare system. Their contribution was as varied as the individuals providing the support services to patients and clerical assistance to staff. Volunteers provided support in most hospital departments and at primary and specialty care sites throughout the year - in filing records, escorting patients, knitting for The Birthplace, registering patients for Mercy's flu and vascular clinics, greeting visitors, staffing the Gift Shop, and assisting with childcare in our transitional housing program. Portland is one of nine designated Refugee Resettlement Communities in the United States and welcomes primary and secondary immigrants as well as those seeking political asylum from around the world. The Manager of Mission Services works closely with the Department of Health and Human Services to develop meaningful roles for mothers involved in Maine's welfare to work program called ASPIRE (Additional Support for People in Retraining and Employment) and new immigrants to assist them to become accustomed to the workplace environment. In 2010, Mercy offered English as a second language classes for volunteers and staff in partnership with Portland's Adult Education. Mercy's Employee Health office provided TB tests, flu shots, and inoculations for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella for 83 senior and 76 junior volunteers. Thirteen volunteers required additional lab work and chest xrays as a result of positive TB tests."}, {"Explanation": "Part VI, Line 3: The following is taken from our charity care policy and describes how the organization informs and educates patients on charity care: Public Notice of the availibility of assistance through this policy is made through each of the following means: 1. Posting notices in a visible manner in locations where there is a high volume of inpatient or outpatient admitting/registration, such as emergency departments, billing offices, admitting offices, and hospital outpatient service settings. 2. Posting notice of availiablity of assistance and contact names and phone numbers on the organization's website. 3. Providing unisured patients a matrix outlining the types of financial assistance available. Upon request, a full text copy of the Charity Care policy should be made available. 4. Making available to the public on a reasonable basis: the annual charity care provided; the unreimbursed costs of care provided to the benificiaries of government programs that serve the poor (being defined as shorfalls between costs and off-setting reimbursement/revenue that the organization experiences in providing care under the Medicaid and local/county indigent programs for care provided to Medicare beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicaid). Posted notices (as listed above) shall be in the primary languages(s) of the service area and in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Should any provision of this Policy conflict with the State of Maine requirements surrounding Charity Care, State law shall supersede the conflicting policy provision and the facility shall act in conformance with applicable State law."}, {"Explanation": "Part VI, Line 4: The geographic area served by Mercy Hospital programs is primarily Cumberland and York counties in south coastal Maine. Two distinct geographic exceptions are the Mercy Recovery Center, Maine's largest addiction treatment facility, which serves patients statewide, and the Northern New England Eating Disorders Program, the only such program located north of Massachusetts. The \"community\" can be defined in micro fashion, i.e. the city and discreet neighborhood in which Mercy is located, and in macro fashion, i.e. the larger geographical service area (primarily the two counties, but with a widening catchment area). Portland and the West End - Mercy's acute care campuses at Fore River and State Street are located in the West End neighborhood of Portland (Cumberland County), the state's most populous city (pop. 63,591). While population density for the state as a whole is 37 people per square mile, and for Portland itself is 3,029 people per square mile, in the West End (the state's most densely populated neighborhood) the density measure is 10,568 people per square mile. While median income is lower in Portland than in the rest of the state, median income in the West End is lower than Portland's by $7,800 ($35,770 vs. $43,603). In addition, while as a designated Refugee Resettlement City, Portland has a more culturally and ethnically diverse population than Maine (9.4% vs. 3.6% non-white), a larger percentage of residents are foreign born (8.1% vs. 7.6%) in the West End than in the rest of Portland. Portland is home to the largest population of Somali, Sudanese, Rwandan and other pan-African populations in Maine, as well as large populations of Hispanics, Asians, Russians and other ethnic groups. In summary, Portland is more densely populated, poorer and more culturally diverse than the rest of Maine, and our immediate neighborhood, the West End, is even more so in all three categories. Portland is also home to a significant population of homeless individuals, drawn to the city by the network of homeless-serving social service agencies, including a dedicated FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Center) operated by the City of Portland Public Health Division, located less than a mile from Mercy's State Street Campus. This FQHC is strictly for homeless individuals, though Portland Public Health and Mercy Hospital collaborate to provide clinic based services to the poor who are Medicaid (MaineCare) ineligible by subsidizing the Portland Free Clinic with funding and volunteers. A second FQHC, the Portland Community Health Center for MaineCare eligible individuals and children opened in 2009. Mercy Hospital provides the necessary ancillary services and referrals for inpatient admissions from the FQHCs.Mercy's involvement in a wide range of community benefit initiatives to improve the health and lives of individuals and families in the City of Portland is discussed elsewhere in this narrative. Overall Service Area - While the Portland community is a major focus of Mercy healthcare and community involvement, the organization's catchment area (Cumberland and York counties, and wider) also includes more rural areas such as Gorham (\"very rural\" designation, with a pop. of 4,302) , Standish (\"rural\" pop. 9,895) , and Buxton (\"rural\" pop. 8,072) . To facilitate access to primary care - the basic building block of healthcare reform - in these outlying rural areas, Mercy has established primary care practice (PCP) sites in several of them: Windham; Gorham; Standish; and West Falmouth. These are in addition to PCP sites in Portland and Westbrook. Both the micro and macro communities share some common demographic themes, and in fact share them with the rest of Maine - populations that are more socioeconomically challenged, older, and have higher rates of chronic illness than much of the US. Poverty is a known determinant of poor health, and the percentage of people living below the poverty level is higher in the City of Portland (14.1%) than in Maine (12.6%) and nationally (13.2%). US Census figures for 2008 also reveal that the city of Portland, Cumberland County, York County, and the State of Maine all have higher percentages of residents over age 65 than the US as a whole (13.9%, 13.9%, 14.6%, 15.1% vs. the US average of 12.8%). The elderly have higher rates of chronic illness such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis, and present a special challenge to Mercy (addressed by our VNA Home Health & Hospice division). While Portland has one of the few city-based public health departments in the state (Portland Public Health, with whom Mercy collaborates to provide care to the poor and disadvantaged), Maine is in the process of developing a statewide public health system with eight distinct districts, to address community health needs, including (but not limited to) reducing disparities and lowering the rate of chronic illness, Emergency Department utilization, etc. Mercy's service area is included within two of these districts: the Cumberland District and the York District. Our involvement with community and public health initiatives is discussed elsewhere in this narrative."}, {"Explanation": "Part VI, Line 6:"}, {"Explanation": "Part VI, Line 6: In addition to the activities listed in Part VI, Line 2, the Hospital maintains an open medical staff and is governed by a board consisting largely of independent members.Part VI, Line 7:CHE's Community Benefit report is filed in AL, CT, DE, FL, GA, ME, MA, NJ, NY, NC an PA.Part VI, Line 2 - Continued:Advanced Patient AdvocacyMercy Hospital utilizes the services of Advanced Patient Advocacy to assist patients who do not have insurance or have minimal health coverage in covering medical costs.
