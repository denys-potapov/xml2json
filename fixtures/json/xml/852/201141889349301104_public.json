READ'S MISSION IS TO DELIVER A PROVEN, REPLICABLE K-12 MODEL TO ENSURE READING SUCCESS FOR STRUGGLING READERS THROUGH THE USE OF PEER TUTORS.", "SignificantNewProgramServices": "0", "SignificantChange": "0", "Expense": "421761", "Description": "Team Read's mission is to deliver a proven, replicable K-12 model to ensure reading success for struggling readers through the use of peer tutors. Team Read is the largest cross-age tutoring program in the Seattle area. Since 1998 Team Read has helped thousands of at-risk students in Seattle Public Schools achieve reading success while providing employment and community service opportunities for thousands of high school students. Team Read's literacy intervention targets primarily 2nd and 3rd graders reading significantly below grade level at the Seattle elementary schools with the greatest need for literacy support. Team Read's innovative cross-age tutoring program pairs carefully trained teens with these struggling readers, yielding dramatic reading improvements. Ninety percent of participating elementary students are low-income, 85% are students of color and 50% are English Language Learners (ELL). During the 2009-10 school year, a total of 527 elementary students participated in Team Read programs. A total of 400 8th through 12th graders participated in Team Read as reading tutors.Reading Tutoring Core Program: Team Read's core tutoring program pairs high school tutors with 2nd & 3rd grade struggling readers (327 2nd and 3rd graders during the 2009-10 school year). Elementary students love working with their high school tutors. The program develops their vocabulary, fluency and comprehension skills, while tapping into the desire of teenagers to make a positive difference in their communities as they gain meaningful work and community service experience. Tutors can choose to work for community service hours, save money for college or receive hourly pay. Reading Mentors: Team Read's Reading Mentors program pairs 8th graders with 2nd & 3rd grade struggling readers. An expansion of the core program, this pilot program engages middle school students in community service opportunities, develops their leadership skills and gives them valuable volunteer experience in their community. The program's popularity continues to grow as 8th graders thrive on the opportunity to become a mentor and tutor for a young reader.Reading Leaders: Team Read's Reading Leaders program pairs 4th & 5th graders with struggling 1st grade readers. This program yields literacy benefits for both age groups. 1st graders are provided 1-on-1 reading support through three hours a week of after-school reading tutoring. Fourth and fifth graders develop and practice their own reading skills as they teach vocabulary words, model reading, and teach reading comprehension, all while developing their skills as role models.With Team Read's support, each year hundreds of elementary students become much better readers. Recent program evaluation results show:70% of participating elementary students gained a year or more in their reading skills. 95% of principals, teachers & parents reported that Team Read improves reading skills and motivation. 87% of tutors said that Team Read was a positive experience that gave them a sense of accomplishment. Growing numbers of high school students apply to work for the program because they were tutored in Team Read - and they want to give back. Team Read is considered an invaluable literacy intervention at the 10 partner elementary schools served by the program.", "TotalProgramServiceExpense": "421761",
