Top quality specialty care is offered including: cardiology, oncology and hematology, orthopaedics, occupational health, pain management, pediatric endocrinology, physical rehabilitation, pulmonology, sleep disorders, sports medicine, and wound care. FMH is noted for innovation. This was Maine's first hospital to offer prenatal nurse home visits to all first-time parents, the first to perform laparoscopic gall-bladder surgery, the first rural Maine hospital to install a 64-slice CT scanner, and the first in the state to declare itself smoke-free. National attention has focused on its efforts to improve access to health care services and preventative health programs. For these reasons, FMH and FCHN have been awarded three of the nation's highest honors for hospital systems from the American Hospital Association: the Living the Vision Award, Foster G. McGaw Finalist Award, and the NOVA Award.The Franklin ScoreKeeper System is credited with contributing to Franklin County's distinction of having the state's lowest \"excess preventable death\" rate for cardiovascular disease.FMH created and is now an affiliate of the Franklin Community Health Network, an integrated network of providers that includes Franklin Health (a multi-specialty group medical practice), Healthy Community Coalition (a health education, outreach, wellness, prevention organization), Evergreen Behavioral Services (a mental-health services provider), and the Western Maine Physicians-Hospital Organization, a negotiating entity made up of physicians and the hospital.Franklin Memorial Hospital is a member of the American Hospital Association and the Maine Hospital Association.Emergency ServicesThe Hospital provides 24-hour emergency services. The Emergency Department is staffed by full-time attending physicians, nursing and support staff.

AHEC Education Center - Established in 2004 the Franklin AHEC program was developed out of great interest from employees and community members requesting local opportunities to pursue careers in the health field and educational programs for retention and professional growth. The Franklin AHEC allows us to meet the needs of the rural population. It also brings to the Maine AHEC Network the resources of a large innovative rural health system that include a community hospital, Maine's oldest Healthy Community Coalition and the Ben Franklin Center which houses a state of the art education center, medical library facilities, and distance learning opportunities. The program has greatly expanded to include many aspects and activities for retention and recruitment for health careers in our vast rural catchment area. Becoming an AHEC center allows us to partner with youth programs, public schools, multiple colleges, adult education, a local career center and other health career programs to offer community members, displaced workers and current healthcare employees the opportunity to continue or pursue careers. 3. HealthInfoNet: Since August 15 hospitals including FMH, and more than 2,000 health care providers in Maine now have access to a new consolidated electronic health record made possible by HealthInfoNet that contains critical information drawn from records that have traditionally been separately maintained in physician practices, hospitals and other settings. Armed with more complete and timely information about a patient, clinicians can provide better quality care and improve the coordination of care, particularly for those patients who see several providers and receive care in more than one community or setting.

Advanced Women's Advocacy Program - provide low cost space to provide services in the community.3.

Your HealthCard will also be honored for discounts at participating area businesses listed four times a year in the newspaper insert Hands on Health. The HealthCard supports and promotes businesses within our region. More than 250 businesses are enjoying the benefits of belonging to the HealthCard Business Program. These businesses in turn offer HealthCard holders exciting discounts and benefits.
