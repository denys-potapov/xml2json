Personal Support Services:These services are delivered to individuals with intellectual and physical disabilities in their own homes or apartments, throughout Northern and Central Aroostook County.

Individuals are encouraged to pursue their wants, needs, and desires.Personal Support Services are delivered by Direct Support Professionals. Staff members are trained in areas that include person centered planning, medication administration, behavior management, residential rights, and environmental safety. The support of the staff allows individuals to live as independently as possible in the community. In fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, NMG supports three individuals under this program.Shared Living:Shared living is a joint service of NMG and DHHS that provides family living arrangements for adults with intellectual and physical disabilities in Northern and Central Aroostook County. The objective of shared living is to provide adults with a warm and supportive home, which allows an individual to live a more independent life and become part of a family and their community. After assessing their strengths and challenges, adults are placed in arrangements where it is most likely that their needs can be met. There are two options for shared living arrangements. An adult with intellectual and physical disabilities may move into a family's home. The other option is for a person who would like to provide support to move into the home of an adult with cognitive or physical disabilities. Considering the family structure of the shared living environment and the needs of the adult helps us ensure that we have made the best placement possible for everyone. We are committed to stopping the cycle of multiple placements that some adults have experienced. Northern Maine General delivers in-home support, training, and emergency crisis consultation services to our shared living providers. Northern Maine General works in a team effort with providers so that we can all make a difference in an adult's life. In fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, NMG is contracted with nine shared living providers who support ten adults with intellectual disabilities.</Description>

        <Description>Powell Memorial Center:Northern Maine General's Powell Memorial Center Day Program's purpose is to teach individuals with intellectual and physical disabilities the skills necessary to reach their full potential for independent community living. Powell Day Program operates five days per week, serving individuals ages eighteen and older who have been diagnosed with mental retardation and/or autism. The program serves a wide range of people, from high school graduates who need to learn transition skills in order to live independently, to adults in long term residential care. The program's goal is to focus an individual's skills and build on them, enhancing physical and emotional development. This goal is achieved by providing choices and offering skill building activities that are practical and related to everyday living. Activities are designed to increase individuals' independence in their living, learning, working, and social environments. In order to help participants achieve their goals, the program takes place in the least restrictive environment possible, some in classroom settings and others throughout the community, using public community resources. All learning is targeted towards reaching a long-term goal, whether it is to live independently in the community or to become independent in specific activities of daily living. Activities can be broken down into two main categories: those pertaining to physical well-being, and those related to social and emotional well-being. Activities related to physical well-being might include following a land or aquatic exercise program developed by a physical therapist, or activities designed to maintain or increase strength. The Powell Day Program facility has a large gym and is adjacent to an indoor therapeutic pool facility which participants use regularly for exercise. Independent living skills are taught, as well, including programs that teach proper nutrition and cooking. Social and emotional well-being is enhanced by participation in community service projects and other small group activities targeting community inclusion. In fiscal year 2011, Powell Memorial Center's Day Program served 34 adults.</Description>

Family participation may also mean participating in treatment, modeling, and reinforcing skills learned in the course of treatment.During the course of treatment a Comprehensive Assessment is completed and is used to identify strengths and needs of the member and family and to guide the development of an Individual Treatment Plan.

The treatment team then works to develop the Individual Treatment Plan (ITP). The treatment plan is created to identify each consumer's unique goals and is based on strengths and needs identified in the comprehensive assessment. The Individual Treatment Plan includes a Crisis/Safety Plan and a Discharge Plan, along with other elements of the plan of care. The Individual Treatment Plan describes the medically necessary treatment the member will receive.Currently, Northern Maine General provides services to clients in Central and Northern Aroostook County. The program is clinically supervised by an LCSW and all program staff members receive required training and education to qualify them each as a Behavioral Health Professional.
